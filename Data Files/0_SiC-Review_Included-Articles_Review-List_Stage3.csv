Conventional technologies based on titanium or ceramic packaging, however, are not suitable for encapsulating microfabricated devices due to their limited scalability, incompatibility with microfabrication processes, and difficulties with miniaturization. A variety of emerging materials have been proposed for encapsulation of microfabricated implants, including thin-film inorganic coatings of Al2O3, HfO2, SiO2, SiC, and diamond, as well as organic polymers of polyimide, parylene, liquid crystal polymer, silicone elastomer, SU-8, and cyclic olefin copolymer. While none of these materials have yet been proven to be as hermetic as conventional metal packages nor widely used in regulatory approved devices for chronic implantation, a number of studies have demonstrated promising outcomes on their long-term encapsulation performance through a multitude of fabrication and testing methodologies.

The structure and properties of silicon carbide depend on the preparation conditions. Amorphous SiC (a-SiC) can be easily prepared by low temperature (400 degreesC) chemical vapour deposition (CVD) from the SiH4/CH4 gas mixture, and hydrogen incorporation allows to decrease the defect density down to 10(17) cm(-3) and to obtain high luminescent yield material. At 900 degreesC solid phase epitaxy takes place on (1 1 2 0) and (0 0 0 1) substrates, and the residual disorder depends on the crystallographic orientation. At 1650 degreesC CVD at low pressure on single crystal gives free-of-defects layer (10(14) cm(-3)) with high electron mobility up to 400 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for 4H substrate. High growth rate (1 mm/h) for SiC bulk is reached with sublimation process at temperature as high as 2400 degreesC, however, macroscopic defects as micropipes or polytype inclusions are present.

The risks induced by this structural behaviour do not cancel the undeniable need for ceramics in applications with extreme environmental demands. These constraints could be a high working temperature or wear, where metals cannot be used, or in contact with the human body, where the inherent chemical resistance of ceramics makes them more biocompatible and durable. While the first statement on brittleness still holds true for most ceramics, solutions have been found for some: damage-resistant Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) are now part of plane engines, and tough zirconia-based ceramics are routinely used in orthopaedic and dental implants. Because of the intrinsic brittleness of ceramics, the required toughness increase must be introduced by tailoring their microstructure. A lot of ground has been covered since the first descriptions of the toughening mechanisms in ceramics in the 1970s. The goal of this review is thus three-fold: summarise the necessary background in fracture mechanics to discuss complex fracture behaviours, provide a picture of the recent development on all the strategies to toughen ceramics, and finally extract lessons on the efficiency of these various toughening mechanisms. In terms of materials, this review will cover CMCs, zirconia-based ceramics, and bulk ceramics using microstructural engineering, which includes the combination of elongated grains with grain boundary engineering, using carbon allotropes, MAX phases, and bioinspired microstructures. For each we will discuss both the core toughening mechanisms and the most recent studies on it. By gathering all these research strands, we will provide in the final part a reflection on the link between toughness and pseudo-ductile behaviour and how it can help to hopefully reach uncharted territory in terms of structural properties in the future.

The development of coated stents has raised expectations on substantial lowering restenosis after stenting with decreasing the rate of restenosis and a reduction in the rate of clinical events. OBJECTIVES: The present analysis addresses the questions on medical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of various coated stent types in CHD. METHODS: The literature was searched in December 2004 in the most relevant medical and economic databases. The medical evaluation was conducted on the basis of published RCT. The data from the studies regarding various angiographic, sonographic and clinical endpoints were checked for methodical quality and summarised in meta-analyses. Within the scope of economic evaluation the primary studies were analysed and modelling was performed, applying clinical effect estimates from the meta-analyses of the medical evaluation and current estimates of German costs. RESULTS: MEDICAL EVALUATION: Ten different stenttypes were used in the included 26 RCT. The results for heparin, silicon-carbide, carbon and PTFE coated stenttypes could not reveal any significant differences between the medical effectiveness of coated and uncoated stents. The application of sirolimus, paclitaxel, everolimus and 7-hexanoyltaxol eluting stents showed a significant lower restenosis at 6-9 months with decrease in the rate of restenosis for polymer-based sirolimus, paclitaxel and 7-hexanoyltaxol eluting stents. In contrast, the use of gold-coated and actinomycin-D eluting stents was associated with a significantly higher restenosis. The polymer-based sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents also showed a significant and considerable reduction in the rate of repeated percutaneous revascularisations at 6-12 months (3.5% vs. 19.7%; p<0.0001, RR=0.19 [95%CI: 0.11; 0.33] and 3.5% vs. 12.2%; p<0.0001, RR=0.30 [95%CI: 0.20; 0.43]) and an equivalent reduction in the rate of combined events. The 7-hexanoyltaxol-eluting stents caused, however, a significant increase of stent thrombosis as well as of myocardial infarctions. ECONOMIC EVALUATION: The allocation to polymer-based sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents resulted in incremental costs (compared with uncoated stents) of approximately 1,421 â‚¬ and 1,234 â‚¬ per patient, taking in account expected revascularisations during the first year after implantation. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness-ratios per avoided revascularisation was 8,881 â‚¬ and 13,711 â‚¬, respectively. The ""break-even""-prices for these stenttypes in the used model were 707 â‚¬ and 551 â‚¬, and the ""break-even""-risks for ISR after stenting with uncoated stent, was 76% and 65%, respectively. The use of the other evaluated coated stents seems not to be cost-effective. DISCUSSION: The absolute effects and cost savings for patient groups with a higher risk of restenosis could be considerably higher than for patient groups with a lower risk of restenosis. The transferability of the results from the present analysis to other (sub)-populations and technology modifications is limited. The direct comparability of the results for sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents is also restricted. CONCLUSIONS: From a medical point of view the use of polymer-based sirolimus or paclitaxel eluting stents can be recommended. The use of gold coated, 7-hexanoyltaxol and actinomycin-D eluting stents is in contrast not recommendable. From an economical point of view and on the basis of current stent prices the polymer-based eluting sirolimus and paclitaxel stents should primarily be recommended for patients with a higher risk of restenosis.",,21289927,x,x,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

OBJECTIVE: It is known that stent thrombogenicity and neointimal formation are determined by the surface characteristics of the stent platform, electrochemical features of the stent surface, and the degree of degradation after implantation. Metallic stents coated with amorphous silicon carbide and biodegradable stents made of magnesium alloy have been introduced clinically, but there are no data available comparing the biocompatibility of these novel stent materials with conventional stents. METHODS: We demonstrate simple and reproducible in vitro methods assessing the rate of platelet adhesion and thrombus activation for biocompatibility tests of different stent surfaces. RESULTS: We show that amorphous silicon carbide and magnesium alloy stent surfaces markedly lower the rate of platelet adhesion and platelet/fibrin activation when compared with uncoated stainless steel or cobalt chromium alloy surfaces. Semiconductor materials on the stent surface reduce platelet and fibrin activation by increasing the critical electron gap to greater than 0.9 eV resulting in a lower electron transfer out of the stent material. CONCLUSION: Passive stent coatings with specific semiconducting properties such as amorphous silicon carbide or magnesium alloy reduce thrombogenicity and may improve biocompatibility of a stent platform.","platelet function, restenosis, thrombosis, materials, magnesium, silicon carbide, stainless steel, hemocompatibility",19235237,x,x,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

In the crystal growth, bulk and homoepitaxial growth are picked up, and crystal quality and electrical properties are described. For electronic devices, various device processes are argued. Power devices based on SiC are stressed in this review.        Bulk single crystals of SiC can be grown by a sublimation method, and large-area 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC single crystals are obtained. The occurrence of SiC polytypes is affected by the growth condition, and can be controlled successfully by optimizing these conditions. 6H-SiC is grown on 6H-SiC (0001) Si-faces, and 4H-SiC on 6H-SiC (000 (1) over bar) C-faces. The crystallinity of bulk crystals is investigated by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray analysis, and characterization is carried out in detail by optical and electrical measurement.        Successful homoepitaxial vapor phase growth of SiC can be realized using off-axis {0001} substrates prepared by a sublimation method called ''step-controlled epitaxy''. Since the crystallinity of epilayers is improved during the step-controlled epitaxy, this growth technique is a key for getting high-quality crystal surfaces. Impurity doping is controlled during homoepitaxial growth by employing impurity gases, such as Nz, trimethylaluminum (TMA), and B2H6. A wide-range of carrier concentrations of 5 x 10(13)similar to 3 x 10(18) cm(-3) for n-type and 5 x 10(16)similar to 3 x 10(20) cm(-3) for p-type are realized. The impurity-incorporation mechanism in the step-controlled epitaxy is discussed based on the C/Si ratio dependence of impurity doping.        Electrical properties of SiC grown by step-controlled epitaxy are determined precisely. A high electron mobility of 720 cm(2)/Vs is obtained in an undoped 4H-SiC epilayer with an electron concentration of 2.5x10(16) cm(-3) at 300 K. This electron mobility is about two times higher than that of 6H-SiC (similar to 380 cm(2)/Vs). High breakdown fields of 1 similar to 5x10(6) V/cm are obtained for both 6H- and 4H-SiC, one order of magnitude higher than those for Si. A high saturation electron drift velocity of 1.6x10(7) cm/s is obtained in 4H-SiC, which may make possible high performance of high-frequency 4H-SiC power devices. Impurity levels and deep levels are investigated by Hall effect, admittance spectroscopy, and DLTS measurement. Metal/4H-SiC Schottky barrier heights are characterized and a strong dependence on metal work function without strong ''pinning'' is elucidated.        Device processes are described for ion implantation. Interface properties of SiO2/SiC are characterized in detail using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure devices. Power electronic applications of SiC for high-voltage junction devices, MOS field effect transistors (FETs), and high-frequency devices are introduced. An optimum design for high-voltage 4H-SiC Schottky rectifiers is described, and high performance obtained experimentally is demonstrated.",,,x,x,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Electrodeposition is a cost-effective method to produce the Ni/SiC composites with high uniformity. However, materials and process parameters of Ni/SiC electrodeposition have immense impact on the amount and the uniformity of the co-deposited SiC particles. In this study, machine learning algorithms are used to investigate the effect of electrodeposition parameters and materials on the Ni/SiC composite. Association rule mining (ARM) is used to determine the important factors leading to high SiC incorporation and artificial neural network (ANN) is used to build a model that can predict the amount of SiC particles in the deposit. ARM results clearly present that the use of cationic dispersants, especially AZTAB and TMAH, at concentrations higher than 1 g l(-1) is highly beneficial for high SiC incorporation into the deposit. Moreover, the ANN model shows that the estimation of SiC vol.% in the composite is possible with high prediction accuracy; the RMSE values of the training and the testing set are calculated as 5.49 and 6.61, respectively.

Despite several disadvantages of the metallic implants, they continue to be used, primarily because of their superior mechanical properties. In order to minimize the harmful effects of the metallic implants and its by-products, several modifications are being made to these materials, for instance nickel-free stainless steel, cobalt-chromium and titanium alloys are being introduced to eliminate the toxic effects of nickel being released from the alloys, introduce metallic implants with lower modulus, reduce the cost of these alloys by replacing rare elements with less expensive elements etc. New alloys like tantalum, niobium, zirconium, and magnesium are receiving attention given their satisfying mechanical and biological properties. Non-oxide ceramics like silicon nitride and silicon carbide are being currently developed as a promising implant material possessing a combination of properties such as good wear and corrosion resistance, increased ductility, good fracture and creep resistance, and relatively high hardness in comparison to alumina.

Bioelectronic devices provide seamless integration between electronics and biological tissue, offering unique functions for healthcare applications such as real-time and online monitoring and stimulation. Organic semiconductors and silicon-based flexible electronics have been dominantly used as materials for wearable and implantable devices. However, inherent drawbacks such as low electronic mobility, particularly in organic materials, instability, and narrow band gaps mainly limit their full potential for optogenetics and implantable applications. In this context, wide-band-gap (WBG) materials with excellent electrical and mechanical properties have emerged as promising candidates for flexible electronics. With a significant piezoelectric effect, direct band gap and optical transparency, and chemical inertness, these materials are expected to have practical applications in many sectors such as energy harvesting, optoelectronics, or electronic devices, where lasting and stable operation is highly desired. Recent advances in micro/nanomachining processes and synthesis methods for WBG materials led to their possible use in soft electronics. Considering the importance of WBG materials in this fast-growing field, the present paper provides a comprehensive Review on the most common WBG materials, including zinc oxide (ZnO) for II-VI compounds, gallium nitride (GaN) for III-V compounds, and silicon carbide (SiC) for IV-IV compounds. We first discuss the fundamental physical and chemical characteristics of these materials and their advantages for biosensing applications. We then summarize the fabrication techniques of wide-band-gap semiconductors, including how these materials can be transferred from rigid to stretchable and flexible substrates. Next, we provide a snapshot of the recent development of flexible WBG materials-based wearable and implantable devices.

While the scale of clinical devices is relatively large, translational, and pilot clinical applications are underway for microelectrode-based systems. Microelectrodes have the advantage of stimulating a relatively small tissue volume which may improve selectivity of therapeutic stimuli. Current microelectrode technology is associated with chronic tissue response which limits utility of these devices for neural recording and stimulation. One approach for addressing the tissue response problem may be to reduce physical dimensions of the device. ""Thinking small"" is a trend for the electronics industry, and for implantable neural interfaces, the result may be a device that can evade the foreign body response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review paper surveys our current understanding pertaining to the relationship between implant size and tissue response and the state-of-the-art in ultrasmall microelectrodes. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The literature review shows recent efforts to create microelectrodes that are extremely thin appear to reduce or even eliminate the chronic tissue response. With high charge capacity coatings, ultramicroelectrodes fabricated from emerging polymers, and amorphous silicon carbide appear promising for neurostimulation applications. CONCLUSION: We envision the emergence of robust and manufacturable ultramicroelectrodes that leverage advanced materials where the small cross-sectional geometry enables compliance within tissue.

SiC is both bio and hemocompatible, and is already commercially used for long-term human in vivo applications ranging from heart stent coatings and dental implants to short-term diagnostic applications involving neural implants and sensors. One challenge facing the medical community today is the lack of biocompatible materials which are inherently smart or, in other words, capable of electronic functionality. Such devices are currently implemented using silicon technology, which either has to be hermetically sealed so it does not directly interact with biological tissue or has a short lifetime due to instabilities in vivo. Long-term, permanently implanted devices such as glucose sensors, neural interfaces, smart bone and organ implants, etc., require a more robust material that does not degrade over time and is not recognized and rejected as a foreign object by the inflammatory response.

Over the last decade, there has been a drive towards neuromodulatory implants which are wireless and approaching millimeter-scales with increasing electrode count. A so-far unrealized goal for these new types of devices is an in-vivo lifetime comparable to a sizable fraction of a healthy patient's lifetime (>10-20 years). Existing, approved medical implants commonly encapsulate components in metal enclosures (e.g. titanium) with brazed ceramic inserts for electrode feedthrough. It is unclear how amenable the traditional approach is to the simultaneous goals of miniaturization, increased channel count, and wireless communication. Ceramic materials have also played a significant role in traditional medical implants due to their dielectric properties, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high strength, but are not as commonly used for housing materials due to their brittleness and the difficulty they present in creating complex housing geometries.
