However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain's foreign body response (FBR). This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the FBR to possibly enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the FBR is the use of MEAs with reduced cross-sectional geometries. Here, we fabricated 4-shank amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. Each a-SiC MEA shank was 8Â Î¼m thick by 20Â Î¼m wide and had sixteen sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes (4 per shank). A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized pre-implantation in buffered saline and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50Â mV/s and 50,000Â mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30Â kHz impedance values and 50,000Â mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50Â mV/s CV and 1Â Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6Â MÎ© to 13.5Â MÎ©Â at 1Â Hz, 1.2Â MÎ©-2.9Â MÎ©Â at 1Â kHz, and 0.11Â MÎ©-0.13Â MÎ©Â at 30Â kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50Â mV/s was 58.1Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 55.9Â mC/cm(2) on week 16, and at 50,000Â mV/s, 4.27Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 5.93Â mC/cm(2) on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of -0.19 per week. We also classified observed units as fast and slow repolarizing based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow repolarizing units declined at a similar rate. At recording electrode depth, immunohistochemistry showed minimal tissue response to the a-SiC devices, as indicated by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cell response between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices at 150Â Î¼m away from the implant location, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neuronal cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results warrant further investigation of a-SiC MEAs for future long-term implantation neural recording studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Siliconcarbide; Polyimide; Microelectrode; Immunohistochemistry; SIROF,38547834,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

Unlike biosensors that require direct contact with interstitial fluids to trigger chemical reactions to operate, this biocompatible SiC sensor doesn't require a direct interface. The sensing mechanism is based upon a shift in resonant frequency as a function of change in glucose levels which electrically manifests itself as a change in blood permittivity and conductivity. For invivo applications the antenna sensor needs to operate inside the body environment, and it has been determined that the best operational location of this biocompatible SiC biosensor is within fatty tissue in close proximity to blood vessels. To test the sensor as a function of glucose level, measurements using synthetic body fluid (SBF), which is electrically equivalent to blood plasma, and pig blood were performed. Changes in sensor performance to varying glucose levels were measured and a shift in resonant frequency to lower values observed with increasing glucose level. In-vitro sensor performance demonstrated that the sensor showed a dose dependent response to glucose concentration from 120 mg/dl to 530 mg/dl.

Purpose: The study assess the role of decellurized skeletal muscle (DSM) when combined with synthesized porous bioactive silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic and evaluated its ability to augment bone calvaria in a rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen rats were divided into 2 groups; group 1 (n=9), SiC discs (10 Ã— 0.2Â mm) pre-treated with 20% NaOH were placed as an onlay grafts on calvarial bone. Meanwhile, in group 2 (n=9), SiC discs pre-treated with 20% NaOH (10 Ã— 0.2 mm) were covered with DSM. After 12 weeks, the grafted tissues were harvested and examined using cone-beam computed tomography, mechanical testing, and histologic analysis. RESULTS: Cone-beam computed tomography for group 2 showed more radio-opacity for the remnant of SiC compared with native bone. The surface area and volume of radio-opacity were 2.48 mm2 Â± 1.6 and 14.9 Â± 7.8 mm3, respectively. The estimated quantitative average surface area of the radio-opacity for group 1 and volume were 2.55 mm2 Â± (Sd=3.7) and 11.25 Â± (Sd=8.9), respectively. Mechanically, comparable values of the flexural strength and statistically significant higher modulus of elasticity of calvaria in group 1 compared with group 2 and control (P<0.001). Histologically, group 2 region of woven bone was seen close to the lamellar bone (native bone), and there was immature bone present near the implanted SiC.

Towards this goal, we propose a method based on creating chemical covalent bonds using intermediate ceramic layers as adhesion promoters between PDMS and parylene.To evaluate our concept, we prepared three different sets of samples with PDMS on parylene without and with oxygen plasma treatment (the most commonly employed method to increase adhesion), and samples with our proposed ceramic intermediate layers of silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon dioxide (SiO2).

Current leakage between adjacent electrodes was ~7.5 nArms over a voltage range of -50 V to 50 V. The devices interacted electrochemically with a purely capacitive relationship at frequencies less than 10 kHz. Electrode impedance ranged from 675 Â± 130 kÎ© (GSA = 496 ÂµmÂ²) to 46.5 Â± 4.80 kÎ© (GSA = 500 K ÂµmÂ²).

Presently, MRI imaging of patients with neural implants is highly restricted in high field MRI (e.g., 3 T and higher) due to patient safety concerns. This results in lower resolution MRI images and, consequently, degrades the efficacy of MRI imaging for diagnostic purposes in these patients. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is a biocompatible wide-band-gap semiconductor with a high thermal conductivity and magnetic susceptibility compatible with brain tissue. It also has modifiable electrical conductivity through doping level control. These properties can improve the MRI compliance of 3C-SiC INIs, specifically in high field MRI scanning. In this work, the MRI compliance of epitaxial SiC films grown on various Si wafers, used to implement a monolithic neural implant (all-SiC), was studied. Via finite element method (FEM) and Fourier-based simulations, the specific absorption rate (SAR), induced heating, and image artifacts caused by the portion of the implant within a brain tissue phantom located in a 7 T small animal MRI machine were estimated and measured. The specific goal was to compare implant materials; thus, the effect of leads outside the tissue was not considered. The results of the simulations were validated via phantom experiments in the same 7 T MRI system. The simulation and experimental results revealed that free-standing 3C-SiC films had little to no image artifacts compared to silicon and platinum reference materials inside the MRI at 7 T. In addition, FEM simulations predicted an ~30% SAR reduction for 3C-SiC compared to Pt. These initial simulations and experiments indicate an all-SiC INI may effectively reduce MRI induced heating and image artifacts in high field MRI.

Consequently, results often have disadvantages with respect to both aspects. With regard to biocompatibility, the activation of the clotting system by alloplastic materials is of great significance, because it necessitates anticoagulant therapy. Further improvements in implant technology require an understanding of the interactions between blood and implants. Therefore a microscopic model of thrombogenesis at alloplastic surfaces is briefly presented, relating thrombogenicity of a material to the electronic structure of its surface. The electronic requirements for high haemocompatibility, which result from this model (especially a low band-gap density of states and a high surface conductivity) are fulfilled by an amorphous alloy of silicon and carbon (a-SiC:H). The advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not obey stoichiometric rules. Thus they allow a continuous adjustment of the electronic parameters without fundamental changes in their mechanical and chemical properties. The theoretical results were checked in vitro by total internal reflection intrinsic fluorescence (TIRIF) spectroscopy as well as thrombelastography experiments (TEG). In comparison with conventional materials such as titanium or LTI carbon, the TEG-clotting time of a-SiC:H-coatings was prolonged by in excess of 200 per cent.

The hypothesis of this study is that non-oxide ceramics like silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4)) and silicon carbide (SiC)-not previously used in the medical field-are not only high strength and mechanically reliable ceramic materials due to their high amount of covalent bonds, but also exhibit a suitable biocompatibility for use as medical implants and prostheses.

Cardiovascular interventions,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine 1-year safety and efficacy after treatment with the COMBO and Orsiro stents. BACKGROUND: The COMBO stainless-steel stent has an anti-CD34(+) antibody coating to capture endothelial progenitor cells, thereby promoting faster endothelialization. The Orsiro is an ultrathin-strut cobalt-chromium stent, covered by an extremely thin layer of amorphous silicon carbide to minimize ion leakage. Both devices elute sirolimus from biodegradable polymers. METHODS: For this analysis we included European patients from the COMBO collaboration, a patient-level pooling of 2Â prospective all-comers registries of COMBO stent implantation (nÂ =Â 2,775), and all patients randomized to the Orsiro stent (nÂ =Â 1,169) from the Dutch BIO-RESORT (Comparison of Biodegradable Polymer and Durable Polymer Drug-Eluting Stents in an All Comers Population) randomized trial. The main outcome of interest was 1-year target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization evaluated using propensity score-matched analysis. RESULTS: At baseline, COMBO patients were older and had more insulin-treated diabetes, renal insufficiency, and other comorbidities. However, Orsiro patients included more current smokers and more acute coronary syndrome presentations. Orsiro patients also received longer stents and had more complex target lesions. After propensity score-matched analysis (nÂ =Â 862/arm), 1-year target lesion failure occurred in 4.1% of COMBO-treated and 2.7% of Orsiro-treated patients (hazard ratio: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.92 to 2.62; pÂ =Â 0.10). Definite stent thrombosis occurred in 0.5% of COMBO-treated and 0.5% of Orsiro-treated patients (pÂ =Â 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: A propensity score-matched comparison of all comers treated with the COMBO or Orsiro stent showed no statistically significant differences. Stent thrombosis risk was low and similar between the stents.

The ability to produce well-defined micro-structures with properties that include chemical inertness, mechanical flexibility and low water uptake are key advantages for these devices. APPROACH: This paper reports the development of the transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) used to deliver intraneural sensory feedback to an upper-limb amputee in combination with a sensorized hand prosthesis. A failure mode analysis on the explanted devices was performed after a first-in-human study limited to 30 d. MAIN RESULTS: About 90% of the stimulation contact sites of the TIMEs maintained electrical functionality and stability during the full implant period. However, optical analysis post-explantation revealed that 62.5% of the stimulation contacts showed signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface. Such damage likely occurred due to handling during explantation and subsequent analysis, since a significant change in impedance was not observed in vivo. Nevertheless, whereas device integrity is mandatory for long-term functionality in chronic implantation, measures to increase the bonding strength of the metallization-PI interface deserve further investigation. We report here that silicon carbide (SiC) is an effective adhesion-promoting layer resisting heavy electrical stimulation conditions within a rodent animal trial. Optical analysis of the new electrodes revealed that the metallization remained unaltered after delivering over 14 million pulses in vivo without signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface. SIGNIFICANCE: Failure mode analysis guided implant stability optimization. Reliable adhesion of thin-film metallization to substrate has been proven using SiC, improving the potential transfer of micro-fabricated neural electrodes for chronic clinical applications.

In contrast, through accelerating rapid endothelialisation and development of an earlier functional endothelial layer, passive coatings have shown encouraging results. The objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical outcome and rate of recurrent stenosis of silicon carbide passive coated cobalt chromium stents (PROKinetic Coronary Stent with PROBIO coating, Biotronik AG, Switzerland) on restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Percutaneous coronary stent deployment was carried out in 161 lesions in 145 consecutive patients. The primary combined endpoint was the rate of target-lesion revascularisation (TLR) and late lumen loss; the secondary endpoints were the procedural success and the major adverse cardiac events at 6-months follow-up. Out of 145 patients, 141 were successfully amenable to a silicon carbide coated stent (PRO-Kinetic, Biotronik AG, Switzerland) implantation (97.2% procedural success).

The extent to which this response compromises the chronic stability of neural devices depends on many factors including the materials used in the electrode construction, the size, and geometry of the indwelling structure. Here, we report on the development of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). APPROACH: This technology utilizes a-SiC for its chronic stability and employs semiconductor manufacturing processes to create MEAs with small shank dimensions. The a-SiC films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and patterned by thin-film photolithographic techniques. To improve stimulation and recording capabilities with small contact areas, we investigated low impedance coatings on the electrode sites. The assembled devices were characterized in phosphate buffered saline for their electrochemical properties. MAIN RESULTS: MEAs utilizing a-SiC as both the primary structural element and encapsulation were fabricated successfully. These a-SiC MEAs had 16 penetrating shanks. Each shank has a cross-sectional area less than 60 Âµm(2) and electrode sites with a geometric surface area varying from 20 to 200 Âµm(2). Electrode coatings of TiN and SIROF reduced 1â€‰kHz electrode impedance to less than 100 kÎ© from ~2.8 MÎ© for 100 Âµm(2) Au electrode sites and increased the charge injection capacities to values greater than 3 mC cm(-2). Finally, we demonstrated functionality by recording neural activity from basal ganglia nucleus of Zebra Finches and motor cortex of rat. SIGNIFICANCE: The a-SiC MEAs provide a significant advancement in the development of microelectrodes that over the years has relied on silicon platforms for device manufacture. These flexible a-SiC MEAs have the potential for decreased tissue damage and reduced foreign body response.

The deposition of an osteoconductive coating is essential for further improvement of its integration with the surrounding tissue. A new strategy towards biomimetic calcium phosphate coatings on bioSiC is described. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that using 10-undecenoic acid methyl ester a covalently bound monolayer can be synthesized on the surface of the bioSiC. After hydrolysis it exposes carboxylic acid groups that promote the selective nucleation and growth of a very well-defined crystalline layer of calcium phosphate.

Further, ion beam imaging is employed to quantify the mineral deposition meanwhile, three-dimensional dual-beam imaging (FIB/SEM) is used to visualize the bioSiC/mineral interface. The monolayer is show to actively induce the nucleation of a well-defined and highly crystalline mixed octacalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (OCP/HAP) coating on implantable bioSiC substrates with complex geometry. The mild biomimetic procedure, in principle, allows for the inclusion of bioactive compounds that aid in tissue regeneration.

APPROACH: We developed a fabrication method that integrates polycrystalline conductive silicon carbide with insulating silicon carbide. The technology employs amorphous silicon carbide as the insulator and conductive silicon carbide at the recording sites, resulting in a seamless transition between doped and amorphous regions of the same material, eliminating heterogeneous interfaces prone to delamination. Silicon carbide has outstanding chemical stability, is biocompatible, is an excellent molecular barrier and is compatible with standard microfabrication processes. MAIN RESULTS: We have fabricated silicon carbide electrode arrays using our novel fabrication method. We conducted in vivo experiments in which electrocorticography recordings from the primary visual cortex of a rat were obtained and were of similar quality to those of polymer based electrocorticography arrays. The silicon carbide electrode arrays were also used as a cuff electrode wrapped around the sciatic nerve of a rat to record the nerve response to electrical stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated the outstanding long term stability of our insulating silicon carbide films through accelerated aging tests. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical translation in neural engineering has been slowed in part due to the poor long term performance of current probes. Silicon carbide devices are a promising technology that may accelerate this transition by enabling truly chronic applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Fabrication Method,Polycrystalline SiC","Animals;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/*chemistry;Electric Stimulation/methods;Electrocorticography/instrumentation/*methods;Electrodes, Implanted;Male;Peripheral Nerves/*physiology;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;Sciatic Nerve/*physiology;Silicon Compounds/*chemistry;Visual Cortex/*physiology",28573982,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

The development of porous implants loaded with antibiotics may enable a local delivery for preventing surface colonization and biofilm formation. A new generation of bio-derived porous ceramic material that mimics hierarchical structures from Nature was evaluated. Silicon carbide ceramics derived from Sapelli wood (bioSiC) were obtained by pyrolysis of Entandrophragma cylindricum wood followed by infiltration with molten silicon. This process renders disks that keep the bimodal pore size distribution (3 and 85Â Î¼m) of the original material and are highly cytocompatible (BALB/3T3 cell line). The ability of the bio-ceramic to load the antimicrobial agent vancomycin was evaluated by immersion of disks in drug solutions covering a wide range of concentrations. The disks released at pH 7.4 an important amount of drug during the first 2 h (up to 11Â mg/g bioSiC) followed by a slower release, which is related to the presence of macro- and mesopores. Finally, the anti-biofilm effect against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was assessed and a considerable reduction (92%) of the bacterial film was observed.

Three porous bioSiCs with important differences in their microstructure were obtained from different natural precursors. Samples loaded with or without VEGF through ionic interactions were cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Cell behaviour and protein activity with regard to bioSiC porous structure and surface properties were analysed. An in vivo model (Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane; CAM) was used to assess the capability of the VEGF loaded systems to promote angiogenesis. Experimental data show that loaded systems were able to control the release of VEGF for up to 15 d ensuring the activity of the protein, increasing the proliferation of HUVECs and the formation of new blood vessels in the CAM. It was found that the selection of bioSiCs with a higher pore size promoted a higher concentration of osteoblastic differentiation markers of MSCs cultured on the surface of bioSiCs. Furthermore, the addition of VEGF to the systems was able to promote a faster osteoblastic differentiation according to the qPCR results, suggesting a synergy between both the surface properties and the controlled release of the growth factor.

However, neural recordings from large mammals such as the pig can be anatomically hindered and pharmacologically suppressed by anesthetics. This curtails comparative inferences. To mitigate these limitations, we set out to modify electrocorticography, intracerebral depth and intracortical recording methods to study the anesthetized pig. In the process, we found that common forms of infused anesthesia such as pentobarbital or midazolam can be neurophysiologic suppressants acting in dose-independent fashion relative to anesthetic dose or brain concentration. Further, we corroborated that standard laboratory conditions may impose electrical interference with specific neural signals. We thus aimed to safeguard neural network integrity and recording fidelity by developing surgical, anesthesia and noise reduction methods andÂ by working inside a newly designed Faraday cage, and evaluated thisÂ from the point of view of neurophysiological power spectral density and coherence analyses. We also utilized novel silicon carbide electrodes to minimize mechanical disruption of single-neuron activity. These methods allowed for the preservation of native neurophysiological activity for several hours. Pig electrocorticography recordings were essentially indistinguishable from awake human recordings except for the small segment of electrical activity associated with vision in conscious persons. In addition, single-neuron and paired-pulse stimulation recordings were feasible simultaneously with electrocorticography and depth electrode recordings.

P. gingivalis and T. denticola reference strains were used to evaluate microbial proliferation. Samples were assessed over 3 and 7 days using fluorescence microscopy with a live/dead viability kit and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the 3-day time point, fluorescence and SEM images revealed a lower density of microorganisms in the 50 nm samples than in the 100 nm samples. However, there was a consistently low density of T. denticola across all the groups. Fluorescence images indicated that most bacteria were viable at this time.

These findings suggest that the titanium nanotube diameter and the presence of the SiC coating influenced bacterial proliferation.

Part A,"Ceramic additive manufacturing currently relies on binders or high-energy lasers, each with limitations affecting final product quality and suitability for medical applications. To address these challenges, our laboratory has devised a surface activation technique for ceramic particles that eliminates the necessity for polymer binders or high-energy lasers in ceramic additive manufacturing. We utilized this method to 3D print bioactive SiC orthopedic screws and evaluated their properties. The study's findings reveal that chemical oxidation of SiC activated its surface, enabling 3D printing of orthopedic screws in a binder jet printer. Post-processing impregnation with NaOH and/or NH(4)OH strengthened the scaffold by promoting silica crystallization or partial conversion of silicon oxide into silicon nitride. The silica surface of the SiC 3D printed orthopedic screws facilitated osteoblast and neuron adhesion and extensive axon synthesis. The silicate ions released from the 3D printed SiC screws favorably modulated macrophage immune responses toward an M1 phenotype as indicated by the inhibition of TNFÎ± secretions and of reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression along with the promotion of IL6R shedding. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, Ti ions released from Ti6Al4V discs promoted macrophage TNFÎ± secretion and ROS expression. In vivo tests demonstrated direct bone deposition on the SiC scaffold and a strong interfacial bond between the implanted SiC and bone. Immunostaining showed innervation, mineralization, and vascularization of the newly formed bone at the interface with SiC.

In the present study, the effect of adding silicon carbide (SiC) on the mechanical and biological behaviors of the nHA/Gel/SiC and bone regeneration in vivo were determined. nHA and SiC were synthesized and characterized by the X-ray diffraction pattern and transmission electron microscope image. Layer solvent casting, freeze drying, and lamination techniques were applied to prepare these scaffolds.

Therefore, the development of new implantable device materials for biomedical applications continues to be an important direction of research and development. Carbon-based nanomaterials are promising candidates and also interesting since carbon has many allotropes with different structures and properties, many of which have also been developed for biomedical devices. Moreover, many carbon allotropes have excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. In this framework, the biocompatibility of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and pyrolyzed-photoresist films, which are three very promising carbon-based nanomaterials (CBN), will be discussed.

Part A,"Bone loss is still a major problem in orthopedics. The purpose of this experimental study is to evaluate the safety and regenerative potential of a new scaffold based on a bio-ceramization process for bone regeneration in long diaphyseal defects in a sheep model. The scaffold was obtained by transformation of wood pieces into porous biomorphic silicon carbide (BioSiCÂ®). The process enabled the maintenance of the original wood microstructure, thus exhibiting hierarchically organized porosity and high mechanical strength. To improve cell adhesion and osseointegration, the external surface of the hollow cylinder was made more bioactive by electrodeposition of a uniform layer of collagen fibers that were mineralized with biomimetic hydroxyapatite, whereas the internal part was filled with a bio-hybrid HA/collagen composite. The final scaffold was then implanted in the metatarsus of 15 crossbred (Merinos-Sarda) adult sheep, divided into 3 groups: scaffold alone, scaffold with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation, and scaffold with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) added during implantation. Radiological analysis was performed at 4, 8, 12 weeks, and 4 months, when animals were sacrificed for the final radiological, histological, and histomorphometric evaluation. In all tested treatments, these analyses highlighted the presence of newly formed bone at the bone scaffolds' interface. Although a lack of substantial effect of PRP was demonstrated, the scaffold+BMSC augmentation showed the highest value of bone-to-implant contact and new bone growth inside the scaffold. The findings of this study suggest the potential of bio-ceramization processes applied to vegetable hierarchical structures for the production of wood-derived bone scaffolds, and document a suitable augmentation procedure in enhancing bone regeneration, particularly when combined with BMSCs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Dental,General SiC,In Vivo Data","Animals;Biocompatible Materials/*pharmacology;Bone Regeneration/*drug effects;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/pharmacology;Ceramics/*pharmacology;Collagen/pharmacology;Durapatite/pharmacology;Mechanical Phenomena/drug effects;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Models, Animal;Osseointegration/drug effects;Osteotomy;Periosteum/drug effects;Prosthesis Implantation;Sheep;Silicon Compounds/pharmacology;Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry;Vegetables/*chemistry;Wound Healing/drug effects",24099033,other,Bone,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The structure and properties of silicon carbide depend on the preparation conditions. Amorphous SiC (a-SiC) can be easily prepared by low temperature (400 degreesC) chemical vapour deposition (CVD) from the SiH4/CH4 gas mixture, and hydrogen incorporation allows to decrease the defect density down to 10(17) cm(-3) and to obtain high luminescent yield material. At 900 degreesC solid phase epitaxy takes place on (1 1 2 0) and (0 0 0 1) substrates, and the residual disorder depends on the crystallographic orientation. At 1650 degreesC CVD at low pressure on single crystal gives free-of-defects layer (10(14) cm(-3)) with high electron mobility up to 400 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for 4H substrate.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1998 to July 1999, 206 patients (62 +/- 5 years) underwent implantation of 231 Tenax stents in 9 centers as the only revascularization procedure. The most frequent clinical indication was unstable angina (66%), and most of the lesions were complex (class B2 and C). The target vessels were the left anterior descending (51%) and right coronary arteries (36%). The ejection fraction was < 0.5 in 19% cases. RESULTS: Revascularization was complete in 70%, elective in 80%, and the implantation was direct in 25% of the cases. The procedure was successful in all the lesions, reducing stenosis from 62 +/- 16 to 16 +/- 10% and increasing the minimal luminal diameter from 0.81 +/- 0.40 to 2.61 +/- 0.59 mm. The TIMI flow was reduced in 30%, but normalized after the stent in all but one case. The incidence of cardiac events was minimal: 1 acute thrombosis (0.5%) resolved by a new angioplasty and 1 non-Q myocardial infarction (0.5%). At the 6-month clinical follow-up 10% of the patients presented complaints of angina greater than class II, and a new angioplasty was carried out in 1.9% of these cases. CONCLUSION: Clinical and angiographic data suggest that the hydrogenated silicon carbide coating of the Tenax coronary stent may indeed play a beneficial role in patient outcome, and should therefore be evaluated by prospective clinical trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,In Vivo Data,Cardiovascular Stent",Coronary angioplasty.

We produced a passive implant to test the in vivo tissue reaction of C57BL/6J mice to 3C-SiC and compare to our positive control of silicon (Si). Dual, triangular shanks were fabricated from each material and combined into a single device which was then implanted simultaneously into three C57BL/6J mouse brains for 35 days.

Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Si produced the expected increased inflammatory response from both microglia/macrophage and astrocyte cells, whereas 3C-SiC shows minimal inflammatory reaction from these glial cells. Si also created tissue voids larger than the implants themselves whereas 3C-SiC showed minimal voids and even still had neuronal processes in contact with the implant.

The risks induced by this structural behaviour do not cancel the undeniable need for ceramics in applications with extreme environmental demands. These constraints could be a high working temperature or wear, where metals cannot be used, or in contact with the human body, where the inherent chemical resistance of ceramics makes them more biocompatible and durable. While the first statement on brittleness still holds true for most ceramics, solutions have been found for some: damage-resistant Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) are now part of plane engines, and tough zirconia-based ceramics are routinely used in orthopaedic and dental implants. Because of the intrinsic brittleness of ceramics, the required toughness increase must be introduced by tailoring their microstructure. A lot of ground has been covered since the first descriptions of the toughening mechanisms in ceramics in the 1970s. The goal of this review is thus three-fold: summarise the necessary background in fracture mechanics to discuss complex fracture behaviours, provide a picture of the recent development on all the strategies to toughen ceramics, and finally extract lessons on the efficiency of these various toughening mechanisms. In terms of materials, this review will cover CMCs, zirconia-based ceramics, and bulk ceramics using microstructural engineering, which includes the combination of elongated grains with grain boundary engineering, using carbon allotropes, MAX phases, and bioinspired microstructures. For each we will discuss both the core toughening mechanisms and the most recent studies on it. By gathering all these research strands, we will provide in the final part a reflection on the link between toughness and pseudo-ductile behaviour and how it can help to hopefully reach uncharted territory in terms of structural properties in the future.

We investigated the insertion mechanics of amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) probes with a view to defining probe geometries that can be inserted into cortex without buckling.Approach. We determined the critical buckling force of a-SiC probes as a function of probe geometry and then characterized the buckling behavior of these probes by measuring force-displacement responses during insertion into agarose gel and rat cortex.Main results.Insertion forces for a range of probe geometries were determined and compared with critical buckling forces to establish geometries that should avoid buckling during implantation into brain.

While the phenotypic and cytoarchitectural arguments for 3D culture are clear, 3D MEA technologies are presently inadequate. This is mostly due to the technical challenge of creating vertical electrical conduction paths (or 'traces') using standardized biocompatible materials and fabrication techniques. Here, we have circumvented that challenge by designing and fabricating a novel helical 3D MEA comprised of polyimide, amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), gold/titanium, and sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROF).

Our goal is to develop flexible and extensible ribbon cables that integrate with thin-film, cortical penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and polyimide were employed as the structural elements of the ribbon cables and multilayer titanium/gold thin films as electrical traces. Using photolithography and thin-film processing, ribbon cables with linear and serpentine electrical traces were investigated. A cable design with an open lattice geometry was also investigated as a means of achieving high levels of extensibility while preserving the electrical function of the cables. Multichannel ribbon cables were fabricated with 50 mm lengths and metallization trace widths of 2-12 mu m. The ribbon cables tolerate flexural bending to a radius of 50 mu m with no change in trace impedance but tolerate less than 5% tensile elongation without trace failure. Ribbon cables with a lattice structure exhibit 300% elongation without failure. The high elongation tolerance is attributed to a lattice design that results in an out-of-plane displacement that avoids fracture or plastic deformation. Extensible ribbon cables underwent up to 50,000 tensile elongation cycles to 45% extension without failure. An electrical interconnect process using through-holes in the distal gold bond pads of the ribbon cables was used to connect to an a-SiC-based MEA. The electrical connection was created by stenciling a conductive epoxy into the through-holes, bridging metallization between the traces, and MEA. The interconnect was tested using a ribbon cable connected to an a-SiC MEA implanted acutely in rat cortex and used to record neuronal activity. These highly flexible and extensible ribbon cables are expected to accommodate large extensions and facilitate cable routing during surgical implantation. They may also reduce tethering forces on implanted electrode arrays, potentially improving chronic neural recording performance.

Load-displacement curve obtained from the indentation experiments showed yielding or incipient plasticity in 4H-SiC typically at a shear stress of about 21GPa (~an indentation depth of 33.8nm) through a pop-in event. An interesting observation was that the residual depth of indent showed three distinct patterns: (i) positive depth hysteresis above 33nm, (ii) no depth hysteresis at 12nm, and (iii) negative depth hysteresis below 12nm.

The development of coated stents has raised expectations on substantial lowering restenosis after stenting with decreasing the rate of restenosis and a reduction in the rate of clinical events. OBJECTIVES: The present analysis addresses the questions on medical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of various coated stent types in CHD. METHODS: The literature was searched in December 2004 in the most relevant medical and economic databases. The medical evaluation was conducted on the basis of published RCT. The data from the studies regarding various angiographic, sonographic and clinical endpoints were checked for methodical quality and summarised in meta-analyses. Within the scope of economic evaluation the primary studies were analysed and modelling was performed, applying clinical effect estimates from the meta-analyses of the medical evaluation and current estimates of German costs. RESULTS: MEDICAL EVALUATION: Ten different stenttypes were used in the included 26 RCT. The results for heparin, silicon-carbide, carbon and PTFE coated stenttypes could not reveal any significant differences between the medical effectiveness of coated and uncoated stents. The application of sirolimus, paclitaxel, everolimus and 7-hexanoyltaxol eluting stents showed a significant lower restenosis at 6-9 months with decrease in the rate of restenosis for polymer-based sirolimus, paclitaxel and 7-hexanoyltaxol eluting stents. In contrast, the use of gold-coated and actinomycin-D eluting stents was associated with a significantly higher restenosis. The polymer-based sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents also showed a significant and considerable reduction in the rate of repeated percutaneous revascularisations at 6-12 months (3.5% vs. 19.7%; p<0.0001, RR=0.19 [95%CI: 0.11; 0.33] and 3.5% vs. 12.2%; p<0.0001, RR=0.30 [95%CI: 0.20; 0.43]) and an equivalent reduction in the rate of combined events. The 7-hexanoyltaxol-eluting stents caused, however, a significant increase of stent thrombosis as well as of myocardial infarctions. ECONOMIC EVALUATION: The allocation to polymer-based sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents resulted in incremental costs (compared with uncoated stents) of approximately 1,421 â‚¬ and 1,234 â‚¬ per patient, taking in account expected revascularisations during the first year after implantation. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness-ratios per avoided revascularisation was 8,881 â‚¬ and 13,711 â‚¬, respectively. The ""break-even""-prices for these stenttypes in the used model were 707 â‚¬ and 551 â‚¬, and the ""break-even""-risks for ISR after stenting with uncoated stent, was 76% and 65%, respectively. The use of the other evaluated coated stents seems not to be cost-effective. DISCUSSION: The absolute effects and cost savings for patient groups with a higher risk of restenosis could be considerably higher than for patient groups with a lower risk of restenosis. The transferability of the results from the present analysis to other (sub)-populations and technology modifications is limited. The direct comparability of the results for sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents is also restricted. CONCLUSIONS: From a medical point of view the use of polymer-based sirolimus or paclitaxel eluting stents can be recommended. The use of gold coated, 7-hexanoyltaxol and actinomycin-D eluting stents is in contrast not recommendable. From an economical point of view and on the basis of current stent prices the polymer-based eluting sirolimus and paclitaxel stents should primarily be recommended for patients with a higher risk of restenosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Review,In Vivo Data,Cardiovascular Stent",,21289927,other,Cardiovascular,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Biomorphic SiC ceramics have been synthesized from wood (Hornbeam, Sapele, Tilia and Pear) using a forced impregnation method. The SiC ceramics have been coated with bioactive HA and HA/ZrO2 using effective gas detonation deposition approach (GDD). The surface morphology and cytotoxicity of SiC ceramics as well as phase composition and crystallinity of deposited coatings were analyzed. It has been shown that the porosity and pore size of SiC ceramics depend on initial wood source. The XRD and FTIR studies revealed the preservation of crystal structure and phase composition of in the HA coating, while addition of ZrO2 to the initial HA powder resulted in significant decomposition of the final HA/ZrO2 coating and formation of other calcium phosphate phases. In turn, NIH 3T3 cells cultured in medium exposed to coated and uncoated SiC ceramics showed high re-cultivation efficiency as well as metabolic activity. The recultivation efficiency of cells was the highest for HA-coated ceramics, whereas HA/ZrO2 coating improved the recultivation efficiency of cells as compared to uncoated SiC ceramics. The GDD method allowed generating homogeneous HA coatings with no change in calcium to phosphorus ratio. In summary, porous and cytocompatible bio-SiC ceramics with bioactive coatings show a great promise in construction of light, robust, inexpensive and patient-specific bone implants for clinical application.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Dental,General SiC,Material Properties,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Animals;*Bone Substitutes/chemistry/pharmacology;*Ceramics/chemistry/pharmacology;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible/chemistry/pharmacology;Durapatite/chemistry/pharmacology;*Implants, Experimental;*Materials Testing;Mice;NIH 3T3 Cells;*Silicones/chemistry/pharmacology;Zirconium/chemistry/pharmacology",27524006,other,Bone,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

We investigated the efficacy of a newer generation ultrathin strut silicon-carbide coated cobalt-chromium (CoCr) BMS (SCC-BMS) as compared to an older thin-strut uncoated CoCr BMS (UC-BMS) in patients presenting with coronary artery disease requiring stenting of large vessels (â‰¥3.0â€‰mm). METHODS: All patients randomized to SCC- (nâ€‰=â€‰761) or UC-BMS (nâ€‰=â€‰765) in the two BASKET-PROVE trials were included. Design, patients, interventions and follow-up were similar between trials except differing regimens of dual antiplatelet therapy.

Safety endpoints of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) were also assessed. We used inverse probability weighted proportional hazards Cox regressions adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: Demographics, clinical presentation, and risk factors were comparable between the groups, but patients receiving SCC-BMS underwent less complex procedures. The risk for clinically driven TVR was increased om the SCC-BMS group compared to the UC-BMS group (cumulative incidence, 10.6% vs. 8.4%; adjusted relative hazard [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.05-2.10]). No differences in safety endpoints were detected, cardiac death (1.6% vs. 2.8%; HR, 0.62 [CI, 0.30-1.27]), non-fatal MI (3.2% vs. 2.5%; HR, 1.56 [CI, 0.83-2.91]), and definite/probable ST (0.8% vs. 1.1%; HR, 1.17 [CI, 0.39-3.50]).

Metallic stents coated with amorphous silicon carbide and biodegradable stents made of magnesium alloy have been introduced clinically, but there are no data available comparing the biocompatibility of these novel stent materials with conventional stents. METHODS: We demonstrate simple and reproducible in vitro methods assessing the rate of platelet adhesion and thrombus activation for biocompatibility tests of different stent surfaces. RESULTS: We show that amorphous silicon carbide and magnesium alloy stent surfaces markedly lower the rate of platelet adhesion and platelet/fibrin activation when compared with uncoated stainless steel or cobalt chromium alloy surfaces. Semiconductor materials on the stent surface reduce platelet and fibrin activation by increasing the critical electron gap to greater than 0.9 eV resulting in a lower electron transfer out of the stent material.

Here we propose a three-layered coating for a SUS316L stent, comprising fluorine-incorporated a-C:H (a-C:H:F), silicon-incorporated a-C:H (a-C:H:Si), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) layers (from top to bottom). Each layer was deposited using a radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) method, and the surface free energy of each layer was controlled by the experimental parameters. Thereafter, the three-layer-coated stent was expanded and evaluated under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in order to determine whether or not cracking or delamination had occurred. It can be seen from the SEM images that the occurrence of cracks or delamination was markedly suppressed even in the bent region of the stent after expansion, where the plastic deformation is highly localized when stents are expanded. This indicates that the method we applied in this work can serve as one approach to overcoming the limitation described above. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The stent thrombosis rate (2.7% overall) in the high-risk group (3.6%) was not significantly different from that of the low-risk patients (2.1%).

DESIGN: Open, non-randomized, prospective, observational, feasibility study. PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-five patients (215 stents) were scheduled consecutively with respect to lesions suitable for slotted tube stent implantation. Two subgroups of patients (stents) were identified based on the local thrombotic risk (common indications for stent implantation Ã‘ group I; lesions with high(er) risk for stent implantation (group II). A closed clinical 3Ã12 (mean 6.5 +/- 2.3) months follow-up was done in 126 (92.6%) eligible patients [164 (97.6%) stents]. Angiographic and/or IVUS data were available in 96 of 136 eligible patients (70.6%) after stenting 6.0 +/- 2.1 months). STENT-MATERIAL/MEDICATION: Balloon expandable tantalum three segment slotted tube stents which were coated with silicon carbide, diameter ranged from 2.5 to 4.0 mm were used. Stent deployment was limited by inflation pressure (12Ã16 Bar). Apart from patients with acute myocardial infarction (n = 15 stents) patients received heparin loading dose during the procedure only, no oral anticoagulation except aspirin (300 mg p.d.) and ticlopidine (250Ã500mg p.d.) given over 1 month. RESULTS: Acute complications. No in-hospital mortality occurred, stent-related myocardial infarction was 1.9%; major bleedings 0.5% of implanted stents. Acute stent thrombosis 1.4%, subacute stent thrombosis occurred in 0.5% (no significant difference between group I and II). Late events: From 136 eligible patients (range 15 daysÃ14 months) (187 stents) 92 patients (67.6%) with 142 stents (75.9%) were event-free. In-stent restenosis. Thirty-six percent (biased group of patients with events) resp. 26.8% (including negative clinical events) of the implanted stents were restenosed.

The rates for acute or subacute stent thrombosis are acceptably low even when using post-procedural conventional (aspirin/ticlopidine) anti-thrombotic medication in patients who are at high risk for stent thrombosis.

Together with the inertness of the n-doped regions, very sharp etching contrasts can be achieved.

Chemical-vapor-deposited Parylene-C films were studied as an encapsulation material for such an implantable device. The surface morphology of an implant Affects its biocompatibility; thus, the Parylene-C surface morphology was investigated as a function of the precursor sublimation rate by atomic force microscopy. We found that high precursor sublimation rates resulted in slightly higher root-mean-square surface roughnesses (from 5.78 to 9.53 nm for deposition rates from 0.015 to 0.08 g/min). The crystallinity affects the physical properties of semicrystalline polymers, and various heat treatments were found to modify the crystallinity of Parylene-C films, as assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peak at 2 theta = similar to 14.5 degrees increased in intensity and decreased in full width at half maximum with increasing annealing temperature, indicating an increase in film crystallinity. Poor adhesion would compromise the protection offered by Parylene-C coatings. The adhesion between Parylene-C and silicon, amorphous silicon carbide, and boron silicate glass substrates were evaluated using the standard tape adhesion test from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of delamination failures. The tape adhesion tests indicated strong adhesion for all the as-deposited Parylene films with the application of an adhesion promoter (Silquest A-174(R) silane). However, annealing the deposited films at temperatures from 85 to 150 degrees C in air for 20 min reduced film adhesion, and also the adhesion testing procedure used significantly affects the results obtained. Supporting evidence suggested that the thermal stress generated in the films weakened the adhesive force. We concluded that the Parylene-C film properties (surface morphology, crystallinity, and adhesion) changed during deposition and thermal annealing, suggesting that the Parylene-C film properties can be tailored and that, with care, failure due to film delamination can be avoided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing","CVD thin film, adhesion, surface morphology, crystallinity, Parylene-C",N/A,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 ml of different concentrations of SiC particles (20 vol% SiC; 50 vol% SiC) mixed with 2 % gelatin were injected into an ex-vivo bovine liver. As a reference group, 2 % gelatin without SiC was injected. MWA was performed using a clinical MWA system with different generator settings (10 - 45 W/10 minutes). The temperature was measured at a distance of 5 mm and 10 mm from the applicator. Afterwards the liver tissue was sliced along the short and long axis, the ablation zones were measured on the x, y and z-axis and the ablation volume was calculated. All experiments were performed 5 times (total: 40 experiments). RESULTS: The average maximum temperatures measured at a generator setting of 45 W at a distance of 5 mm from the applicator were 103.4 Â± 4.6 Â°C (20 vol% SiC), 103.3 Â± 6.5 Â°C (50 vol% SiC) and 96.0 Â± 4.2 Â°C in the control group (0 vol% SiC). At 45 W, injection of 20 vol% SIC caused a significantly higher maximum temperature than that achieved in the control group (p = 0.016). No significant temperature increase compared to the control group could be measured using 50 vol% SiC.

In the crystal growth, bulk and homoepitaxial growth are picked up, and crystal quality and electrical properties are described. For electronic devices, various device processes are argued. Power devices based on SiC are stressed in this review.        Bulk single crystals of SiC can be grown by a sublimation method, and large-area 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC single crystals are obtained. The occurrence of SiC polytypes is affected by the growth condition, and can be controlled successfully by optimizing these conditions. 6H-SiC is grown on 6H-SiC (0001) Si-faces, and 4H-SiC on 6H-SiC (000 (1) over bar) C-faces. The crystallinity of bulk crystals is investigated by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray analysis, and characterization is carried out in detail by optical and electrical measurement.        Successful homoepitaxial vapor phase growth of SiC can be realized using off-axis {0001} substrates prepared by a sublimation method called ''step-controlled epitaxy''. Since the crystallinity of epilayers is improved during the step-controlled epitaxy, this growth technique is a key for getting high-quality crystal surfaces. Impurity doping is controlled during homoepitaxial growth by employing impurity gases, such as Nz, trimethylaluminum (TMA), and B2H6. A wide-range of carrier concentrations of 5 x 10(13)similar to 3 x 10(18) cm(-3) for n-type and 5 x 10(16)similar to 3 x 10(20) cm(-3) for p-type are realized. The impurity-incorporation mechanism in the step-controlled epitaxy is discussed based on the C/Si ratio dependence of impurity doping.        Electrical properties of SiC grown by step-controlled epitaxy are determined precisely. A high electron mobility of 720 cm(2)/Vs is obtained in an undoped 4H-SiC epilayer with an electron concentration of 2.5x10(16) cm(-3) at 300 K. This electron mobility is about two times higher than that of 6H-SiC (similar to 380 cm(2)/Vs). High breakdown fields of 1 similar to 5x10(6) V/cm are obtained for both 6H- and 4H-SiC, one order of magnitude higher than those for Si. A high saturation electron drift velocity of 1.6x10(7) cm/s is obtained in 4H-SiC, which may make possible high performance of high-frequency 4H-SiC power devices. Impurity levels and deep levels are investigated by Hall effect, admittance spectroscopy, and DLTS measurement. Metal/4H-SiC Schottky barrier heights are characterized and a strong dependence on metal work function without strong ''pinning'' is elucidated.        Device processes are described for ion implantation. Interface properties of SiO2/SiC are characterized in detail using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure devices. Power electronic applications of SiC for high-voltage junction devices, MOS field effect transistors (FETs), and high-frequency devices are introduced.

The top part of the microneedle is a conical area called tip where four lumens are situated. To design a sharp tip, the surface area is kept about $12.56\ \mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$. A cylindrical body having the height of $220\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ is the middle portion of the microneedle, which has the inner and the outer diameter of $46\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ and $72\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ respectively.

There has been interest in developing methods of tracking single units over multiple separate recordings to study neural processes that take place over several weeks or months, but to date these have primarily used high-density MEAs with hundreds of channels, which allow the use of spatial information in tracking units. Here we developed a method for tracking a single unit over multiple discontinuous recording sessions that makes use of lower density MEA data.

Our classifier achieved an accuracy of 90% and a low false positive rate of 6%.

To overcome this challenge, there is significant research interest in the exploration of novel array architectures and encapsulation materials. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) is biocompatible and corrosion resistant, and has recently been employed as a coating on biomedical devices including planar microelectrode arrays. However, to date, the three-dimensional Utah electrode array (UEA) is the only array architecture which has been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for long-term human trials. APPROACH: Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that UEAs can be fabricated with a-SiC encapsulation and sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrode coatings, and that such arrays are capable of single-unit recordings over a 30 week implantation period in rat motor cortex. Over the same period, we carried out electrochemical measurements, including voltage transients, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), to evaluate potential failure modes. Furthermore, we evaluated chronic foreign body response via fluorescence immunohistochemistry following device explantation. MAIN RESULTS: During the indwelling period, we observed a reduction in active electrode yield percentage from 94.6â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰5.4 (week 1) to 16.4â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰11.5% (week 30). While the average active electrode yield showed a steady reduction, it is noteworthy that 3 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through 24 weeks and 1 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through the whole implantation period.

Silicon-carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs) were computationally synthesized with antimony (Sb) as the major dopant and doped with other transition metal, such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), or chromium (Cr), to improve the adsorption capacity of the nanotube materials through theoretical calculations based on density functional theory.

In contrast to our earlier approach based on polyimide (PI) and epoxy resin with different thermal expansion coefficients, the Î¼LEDs and interconnecting wires are now embedded into a triple-layer stack of a single, biocompatible, and highly transparent epoxy material. The new material combination results in a pronounced reduction of thermomechanical bending in comparison with the material pair of the earlier approach. We developed a spin-coating process enabling epoxy resin layers down to 5 Î¼m at thickness variations of less than 7% across the entire carrier wafer. We observed that the cross-linking of epoxy resin layers strongly depends on the spin-coating parameters which were found to be correlated to a potential separation of epoxy resin components of different densities. Furthermore, various metallization layers and corresponding adhesion promoting layers were investigated. We identified the combination of silicon carbide with a titanium-based metallization to provide the highest peeling strength, achieving an adhesion to epoxy improved by a factor of two. In order to obtain a high process yield, we established a stress-free implant release using the electrochemical dissolution of a sacrificial aluminum layer. The direct comparison of oCI probe variants using a single epoxy material and the combination of PI and epoxy resin revealed that the epoxy-resin-only probe shows minimal thermomechanical probe bending with a negligible hysteresis.

These tests have demonstrated the ability of RAA soak tests to provide rapid in vitro assessment of microfabricated neural interfaces and thereby reduce the time needed to develop synthetic methods to fabricate chronically reliable devices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Electrodes;Metals;Delamination;Implants;Impedance;Adhesives,30441478,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

However, their long-term reliability is challenged by an aggressive implant environment that causes delamination and degradation of critical materials, resulting in a degradation or complete loss of implant function. Herein, a rigorous and in-depth analysis is presented on the fabrication and modification of critical materials in these thin-film neural interfaces. Special attention is given to improving the interfacial adhesion between thin films and processing modifications to maximize device reliability. Fundamental material analyses are performed on the polyimide substrate and adhesion-promotion candidates, including amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H), amorphous carbon, and silane coupling agents. Basic fabrication rules are identified to markedly improve polyimide self-adhesion, including optimizing the polyimide-cure profile and maximizing high-energy surface activation. In general, oxide-forming materials are identified as poor adhesive aids to polyimide without targeted modifications. Methods are identified to incorporate effective a-SiC:H interfacial layers to improve metal adherence to polyimide, in addition to examples of alloying between adjacent material layers that can impact the trace resistivity and long-term reliability of the thin-film interfaces.

The effects of centrifugal casting die speed, melting temperature, the wt.% of reinforcement, and particle size were investigated experimentally based on wear performance and coefficient of friction (CoF). The wt.% of reinforcement (SiC) varied from 10% to 20% and particle size from 40 to 100 mu m. While the die speed and melting temperature varied from 800 to 1200 RPM and 800 to 900 degrees C respectively. Experiments were performed according to the central composite design model. For optimisation and investigation of individual and interaction effect of each variable on wear loss, and CoF response surface methodology tool was used. The statistical study of experimental results showed that reinforcement wt.% is the most influential factor on wear, followed by die speed, particle size, and melting temperature, respectively. The increased wt.% of reinforcement, die speed, and particle size results in decreased wear loss. At the same time, the effect of melting temperature on wear loss was also observed. The effect of melting temperature on wear and CoF was the least, and an increase in melting temperature increases the wear loss, while particle size was the second most influential factor found after reinforcement wt.% on CoF.

Dissolution rates of SiC, SiN x and thermal SiO2 were measured in accelerated soaking tests in saline at 87 Â°C. Defects in SiC films were revealed and analyzed by selectively removing the materials underneath those defects.

We investigated the conceivable utilization of silicon carbide (SiC) as a nano-ceramic covering material of titanium (Ti)-based all out femoral substitution implants. The thought is to keep wear garbage arrangement from the delicate titanium exterior. Silicon carbide is a hard and firmly holding bio-ceramic surface substance, and in light of these physico-chemical properties, it isn't actually degradable, just like the case with apatite (HA). To improve cytocompatibility and osseous-integration, we deposited anodized titanium nanotubes (TiO(2)) inserts, by electrochemical deposition method (EDM), with silicon carbide (SiC) with apatite (SiC@HA). The deposition was affirmed by SEM, while phase composition properties were assessed by XRD. Calcium affidavit, osteocalcin creation, and articulation of bone genes were essentially higher in rodent osteoblast cell culture on SiC@HA-covered anodized titanium nanotubes than in cells cultured on uncoated anodized titanium nanotubes. Implantation into rodent femurs likewise demonstrated that the SiC@HA-covered substance had unrivaled osseous-integration movement in correlation with that of customary inserts, as evaluated by in vivo tomography and histology.

METHODS: Rabbits were randomly divided into LIFU group, LICU group and control group (without ultrasound treatment). The intensities of LICU and LIFU were 30 and 300 mW/cm(2), respectively. The subcutaneous and subperiosteal temperatures were measured continuously during the 20-min ultrasound treatment. Then, the porous SiC scaffolds were implanted into the mandible, followed by LICU or LIFU once daily, and the quantity and structure of bone were assessed by methylene blue-acid fuchsin staining and micro-CT at 3, 6 and 9 weeks after implantation. RESULTS: The changes in the subcutaneous and subperiosteal temperatures during LICU and LIFU were less than 1 Â°C. The bone mass increased and the structure of bone tissues became more mature over time. The bone mass and mean pore occupancy fraction (POF) in the LIFU group were significantly greater than in the LICU group at three time points (P<0.05). Bone ingrowth in different directions was observed, and the new bone formation in the mesial, distal, top, and lingual sides of the implants in the LIFU group was greater than in the LICU group and control group (P<0.05).

Our data indicated that all the tested surfaces supported cell growth, in particular, hASCs seeded on both titanium treated by a double-step etching process (TIT) and titanium modified by two Anodic Spark Deposition processes (TAA) grew better respect to the ones cultured on titanium obtained by KOH alkali etching process on TAA (TAAK). Furthermore, hASCs well colonized SiC-PECVD surface, showing a quite similar viability to cells cultured on plastic (PA). TIT and TAA better supported osteogenic differentiation of hASCs compared to PA, as shown by a marked increase of both alkaline phosphatase activity and calcified extracellular matrix deposition; in contrast TAAK did not positively affect hASCs differentiation.

However, there are very few studies in regard to the toxicological potential of SiC NPs. OBJECTIVES: To study the toxicity and biodistribution of silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles in an in vivo rat model after acute (24h) and subacute (28days) oral administrations. The acute doses were 0.5, 5, 50, 300 and 600mgÂ·kg(-1), while the subacute doses were 0.5 and 50mgÂ·kg(-1). RESULTS: SiC biodistribution and elemental composition of feces and organs (liver, kidneys, and spleen) have been studied by Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE). SiC and other elements in feces excretion increased by the end of the subacute assessment. SiC did not accumulate in organs but some elemental composition modifications were observed after the acute assessment. Histopathological sections from organs (stomach, intestines, liver, and kidneys) indicate the absence of damage at all applied doses, in both assessments. A decrease in the concentration of urea in blood was found in the 50mgÂ·kg(-1) group from the subacute assessment. No alterations in the urine parameters (sodium, potassium, osmolarity) were found. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that assesses the toxicity, biodistribution, and composition changes in feces and organs of SiC nanoparticles in an in vivo rat model. SiC was excreted mostly in feces and low traces were retrieved in urine, indicating that SiC can cross the intestinal barrier. No sign of toxicity was however found after oral administration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,In Vivo Data","Animal Feed/analysis;Animals;Biocompatible Materials/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity;Elements;Feces/*chemistry;Female;Granuloma/chemically induced/pathology;Microscopy, Electron, Transmission;Nanoparticles/*toxicity;Particle Size;Photoelectron Spectroscopy;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Silicon Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity;Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission;Tissue Distribution",22981607,3C-SiC,#N/A,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

However, the lack of effective strategies for growth of high quality SiC NW films have greatly limited their application. In this study, free-standing, transferable SiC NW network films with a good electrical contact have been successfully developed by the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of SiC aerogel-derived NW followed by the high temperature heating bonding process. In order to develop the concept of NW network film on substrate instead of CVD and epitaxial growth of ones and evaluate their application in PDs, SiC NW aerogel derived NW network film on diverse different substrates (rigid semiconductor Si, flexible metal copper foil and transparent flexible PET) have been fabricated. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed PDs can have high on/off ratio (232) prepared by the NW network film on Si substrate, and extremely high photocurrent of 8.12 x 10-4 A, enhanced responsivity of 17.7 A/W, fast response time of 0.1 s as well as high stability and flexibility under different bending based on the film on the copper foil. These excellent performances can be explained by the coupled effect of ultralong 1D-SiC nanostructure with a large length-to-diameter ratio and the high-quality NW network. It is hoped that the current study could open a door to grow SiC NW films to develop the UV PDs with excellent photoresponse characteristics, meeting the demands of high integration PD devices and wearable and implantable SiC devices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Implanted Electronics",,,3C-SiC,Implants_General,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We hypothesized that specific patterns of microstructures on stents can accelerate endothelialisation thereby reducing their thrombogenicity and the DAPT duration. METHODS: Differently designed, 2-5 Î¼m high elevations or hollows were lithographically etched on silicon plates, subsequently coated with silicon carbide. Smooth silicon plates and bare metal substrates were used as controls. To assess attachment and growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells under static or flow conditions, actin cytoskeleton was visualised with green phalloidin. Endothelial migration was assessed in a modified barrier assay. To investigate surface thrombogenicity, platelets were incubated on the structured surfaces in static and flow conditions, and visualised with fluorescein-conjugated P-selectin antibody. Images were taken with incident-light fluorescent microscope for non-transparent objects. RESULTS: Compared to smooth surface, flat cubic elevations (5 Î¼m edge length) improved endothelial cell attachment and growth under static and dynamic conditions, whereas smaller, spiky structures (2 Î¼m edge length) had a negative influence on endothelialisation. Endothelial cell migration was fastest on flat cubic elevations, hollows, and smooth surfaces, whereas spiky structures and bare metal had a negative effect on endothelial migration. Thrombogenicity assays under static and flow conditions showed that platelet adhesion was reduced on the flat elevations and the smooth surface, as compared to the spiky structures, the hollow design and the bare metal substrates. CONCLUSION: Surface microstructures strongly influence endothelialisation of substrates. Designing stents with surface topography which accelerates endothelialisation and reduces thrombogenicity may be of clinical benefit by improving the safety profile of coronary interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,Material Properties,Cardiovascular Stent,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Atherosclerosis, stent endothelialisation, stent thrombogenicity, surface topography",24787629,amorphous,Cardiovascular,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Furthermore, an additional transparent adhesion layer of silicon carbide (SiC) between the polyimide substrate and the ITO layer was integrated. This greatly enhanced the thermal and mechanical stability of ITO on the flexible substrate, which enable many possibilities for future manufacturing processes and applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Implanted Electronics",Indium tin oxide;Electrodes;Silicon carbide;Adhesives;Polyimides;Platinum;Accelerated aging,,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

The initial and final setting times of CPC increased by adding both nano-SiC and nano-TiO2 additives but decreased by using nano-silica. Nano-titania and nano-silica had great effect on compressive strength of as-set CPC whereas slight changes were found by using nano-SiC. Although a sharp increase in compressive strength of all cements was observed by soaking them in physiological solution, the soaked additive-free cements and nano-SiO2-added ones exhibited the greatest strength values. The results showed that adding these nano-additives did not influence on conversion rate of cement reactants to apatite phase during soaking in physiological solution period but the morphology of the formed phase was almost different. Overall, the results determined that nano-SiO2 and nano-TiO2 particles were appropriate additives to improve short-term mechanical strength of CPCs a(s-set CPCs), though nano-SiO2 was found more effective because it improves the long-term mechanical strength of CPC (after soaking) too.

The membranes feature diameters between 600 and 800  $\mu \text{m}$  as well as integrated piezoelectric thin film actuators, thus enabling switching between the bistable states. The membrane material is known to be not biocompatible, hence a hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) layer is deposited on the surface. For demonstration purposes, a 70 nm Â±3 nm thin a-SiC:H coating with a specific silicon to carbon ratio was chosen, with a negligible impact on the overall switching performance of the bistable membranes. Furthermore, a relation between the membrane center velocity at the first characteristic resonance frequency and the switching ability of a membrane in different viscous fluids is shown. Based on a small signal analysis the switching behavior can be predicted. The membranes were successfully switched in liquids with a dynamic viscosity up to 286 mPa $\cdot \text{s}$ . The biocompatibility of the membranes was examined by growing Caco-2 cells, a human carcinoma cell line, on a-SiC:H thin films, featuring different carbon contents and organic surface treatments. The proliferation and adhesion of the cells on the substrates are examined in an empirical cell growth and removal study. Only a-SiC:H surfaces pre-treated with an O2-plasma and coated with Collagen Type I indicated to provide an environment of improved cell adhesiveness compared to other surface treatments. The biological investigations resulted in good cell proliferation, that also depends on the altered hydrophilicity of the surface, as well as on the carbon content of the a-SiC:H thin films. This study reveals that a broad range of biocompatible a-SiC:H surfaces can be prepared, whereby the cell growth can be tailored in terms of proliferation and adhesion for different biomedical application scenarios. Finally, this paper reports on the mechanical features of bistable, buckled membranes and their suitability as a growth substrate for human cell cultures, due to the good biocompatibility of a-SiC:H thin films. We therefore suggest that it will be feasible to grow cells on bistable MEMS membranes, enabling cell experiments in liquid medical environments, with both mechanically excitable and biocompatible surfaces.

The implementation of ultrathin, flexible electrodes that can offer noninvasive attachment to soft neural tissues is a breakthrough for timely, continuous, programable, and spatial stimulations. With strict flexibility requirements in neural implanted stimulations, the use of conventional thick and bulky packages is no longer applicable, posing major technical issues such as short device lifetime and long-term stability. We introduce herein a concept of long-lived flexible neural electrodes using silicon carbide (SiC) nanomembranes as a faradic interface and thermal oxide thin films as an electrical barrier layer. The SiC nanomembranes were developed using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process at the wafer level, and thermal oxide was grown using a high-quality wet oxidation technique. The proposed material developments are highly scalable and compatible with MEMS technologies, facilitating the mass production of long-lived implanted bioelectrodes. Our experimental results showed excellent stability of the SiC/silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) bioelectronic system that can potentially last for several decades with well-maintained electronic properties in biofluid environments. We demonstrated the capability of the proposed material system for peripheral nerve stimulation in an animal model, showing muscle contraction responses comparable to those of a standard non-implanted nerve stimulation device.

While the scale of clinical devices is relatively large, translational, and pilot clinical applications are underway for microelectrode-based systems. Microelectrodes have the advantage of stimulating a relatively small tissue volume which may improve selectivity of therapeutic stimuli. Current microelectrode technology is associated with chronic tissue response which limits utility of these devices for neural recording and stimulation. One approach for addressing the tissue response problem may be to reduce physical dimensions of the device.

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The literature review shows recent efforts to create microelectrodes that are extremely thin appear to reduce or even eliminate the chronic tissue response.

We designed a large scale clinical trial to compare a novel thin strut, cobalt-chromium drug-eluting stent with silicon carbide-coating releasing sirolimus from a biodegradable polymer (O-SES, Orsiro; Biotronik, BÃ¼lach, Switzerland) with the durable polymer-based Xience Prime/Xpedition everolimus-eluting stent (EES) (Xience Prime/Xpedition stent, Abbott Vascular, IL) in an all-comers patient population. DESIGN: The multicenter BIOSCIENCE trial (NCT01443104) randomly assigned 2,119 patients to treatment with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) or durable polymer EES at 9 sites in Switzerland. Patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes, including non-ST-elevation and ST-elevation myocardial infarction, were eligible for the trial if they had at least 1 lesion with a diameter stenosis >50% appropriate for coronary stent implantation. The primary end point target lesion failure (TLF) is a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization within 12 months. Assuming a TLF rate of 8% at 12 months in both treatment arms and accepting 3.5% as a margin for noninferiority, inclusion of 2,060 patients would provide more than 80% power to detect noninferiority of the biodegradable polymer SES compared with the durable polymer EES at a 1-sided type I error of 0.05. Clinical follow-up will be continued through 5 years. CONCLUSION: The BIOSCIENCE trial will determine whether the biodegradable polymer SES is noninferior to the durable polymer EES with respect to TLF.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,In Vivo Data,Cardiovascular Stent",*Absorbable Implants;Acute Coronary Syndrome/*therapy;Coronary Artery Disease/*therapy;*Drug-Eluting Stents;Everolimus;Humans;Percutaneous Coronary Intervention;Research Design;Sirolimus/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives,25173535,amorphous,Cardiovascular,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

LA platforms aim to address the lack of adherence to oral regimens, which has impaired PrEP efficacy. Despite extensive investigations in this field, tissue response to sustained subcutaneous TAF delivery remains to be elucidated as contrasting preclinical results have been reported in the literature. To this end, here we studied the local foreign body response (FBR) to sustained subdermal delivery of three forms of TAF, namely TAF free base (TAF(fb)), TAF fumarate salt (TAF(fs)), and TAF(fb) with urocanic acid (TAF-UA). Sustained constant drug release was achieved via titanium-silicon carbide nanofluidic implants previously shown to be bioinert. The analysis was conducted in both Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and rhesus macaques over 1.5 and 3Â months, respectively. While visual observation did not reveal abnormal adverse tissue reaction at the implantation site, histopathology and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) analyses exposed a local chronic inflammatory response to TAF. In rats, UA mitigated foreign body response to TAF in a concentration-dependent manner. This was not observed in macaques where TAF(fb) was better tolerated than TAF(fs) and TAF-UA. Notably, the level of FBR was tightly correlated with local TAF tissue concentration. Further, regardless of the degree of FBR, the fibrotic capsule (FC) surrounding the implants did not interfere with drug diffusion and systemic delivery, as evidenced by TAF PK results and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Drug Release,In Vivo Data",Long acting drug delivery; Subcutaneous implants; Tenofovir alafenamide; Foreign body response; Immune microenvironment,37120032,other,Drug_Release,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

One challenge facing the medical community today is the lack of biocompatible materials which are inherently smart or, in other words, capable of electronic functionality. Such devices are currently implemented using silicon technology, which either has to be hermetically sealed so it does not directly interact with biological tissue or has a short lifetime due to instabilities in vivo. Long-term, permanently implanted devices such as glucose sensors, neural interfaces, smart bone and organ implants, etc., require a more robust material that does not degrade over time and is not recognized and rejected as a foreign object by the inflammatory response.

However, limited biocompatibility of the applied medical steel can cause acute thrombosis and long-term restenosis. Adhesion of monocytes to stent metal may participate in those acute and long-term complications of stent placement. Based on described prominent electrochemical properties of the interaction between the monocyte integrin receptor Mac-1 and its various ligands, we hypothesized, that this receptor is a central mediator of monocyte adhesion to stent metal and that semiconductor coating of medical steel reduces monocyte adhesion. Adhesion of monocytes on L-316 stainless steel was directly evaluated by light microscopy. Mac-1 could be identified as mediator of monocyte adhesion, since cell adhesion could be blocked by anti-Mac-1-antibodies, including the cross-reacting anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody fragment abciximab. To further prove the central role of Mac-1, two CHO cell lines were generated expressing recombinant Mac-1 either as wild type, resulting in a low affinity receptor, or mutant with a GFFKR deletion of the alpha(M) subunit, resulting in a high affinity receptor. Indeed, adhesion was specific for Mac-1 and dependent on the affinity state of this integrin. Finally, we could demonstrate that Mac-1-mediated adhesion of monocytes to stents can be significantly inhibited by silicon carbide coating of the stent metal. In conclusion, the integrin Mac-1 and its affinity state could be identified as major mediators of monocyte adhesion on medical steel. As therapeutic strategies, the blockade of Mac-1 by antibodies or silicon carbide coating of steel inhibits monocyte adhesion on stents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,Cardiovascular Stent,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Integrin, Mac-1, monocytes, stents, stent coating",12881037,amorphous,Cardiovascular,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

METHODS: This prospective registry enrolled STEMI-patients with multi-vessel disease, thus candidates for a two-step procedure. PCI of the culprit lesion was performed with at least one Orsiro stent that was OCT-analysed during the second-step procedure (deferred to 30,90 and 180-days). RESULTS: 16 of the 95 patients with MVD underwent an OCT evaluation of the study device implanted in the culprit lesion during the second-step staged procedure and were enrolled in the present Registry. A total of 3060-struts were analysed. The percentage of uncovered struts was 19.6% at30-days, 1.3% at90-days and 1.8% at180-days (p<0.001). The percentage of cross section with â‰¥1 uncovered struts were 51.3% at30-days, 6.5% at90-days and 5.7% at180-days (p<0.001). The percentage of cross sections containing thrombus was 6.2% at30-days while no thrombus was detected both at90 and 180-days. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that the new Orsiro stent promotes early and persistent strut coverage with low peri-strut thrombus. This pilot OCT evaluation might suggest a low incidence of late adverse events and anticipate safe outcome after early withdrawal of dual antiplatelet therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,In Vivo Data,Cardiovascular Stent","ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), drug-eluting stent (DES), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), neointimal hyperplasia, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), thrombosis, re-endothelialization",26831901,amorphous,Cardiovascular,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Over the last decade, there has been a drive towards neuromodulatory implants which are wireless and approaching millimeter-scales with increasing electrode count. A so-far unrealized goal for these new types of devices is an in-vivo lifetime comparable to a sizable fraction of a healthy patient's lifetime (>10-20 years). Existing, approved medical implants commonly encapsulate components in metal enclosures (e.g. titanium) with brazed ceramic inserts for electrode feedthrough. It is unclear how amenable the traditional approach is to the simultaneous goals of miniaturization, increased channel count, and wireless communication. Ceramic materials have also played a significant role in traditional medical implants due to their dielectric properties, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high strength, but are not as commonly used for housing materials due to their brittleness and the difficulty they present in creating complex housing geometries. However, thin-film technology has opened new opportunities for ceramics processing. Thin films derived largely from the semiconductor industry can be deposited and patterned in new ways, have conductivities which can be altered during manufacturing to provide conductors as well as insulators, and can be used to fabricate flexible substrates.

The optimal bias voltage applied to conductive substrate was -200 V, whereas for dielectric substrate the bias voltage V-bias did not affect the properties of SiC coating. The analysis of CVCs and spectroscopic diagnostics as the methods for studying the mechanism of interfacial rearrangements to investigate SiC phase transition in nano silicon carbide coatings were used. The conductivity of the SiC coating coincided with the conductivity on the dielectric (mu n(0) = 10(12) ... 10(13)cm(-1).s(-1).V-1). The conductive substrate had a significant effect on the properties of the coating and thus depended on the bias voltage V-bias. The conductivity increased by three-four orders of magnitude (mu n(0) = 3.10(17).m(-1).s(-1).V-1), if the bias voltage V-bias = -200 V. The increase of the bias voltage (V-bias = -600 V) led to a decrease in the conductivity (mu n(0) = 10(11) ... 10(12)cm(-1).s(-1).V-1).

A combination of diamond and SiC may lead to highly stable materials, e.g., for implants or biosensors with excellent sensing properties. Here we report on the controllable surface chemistry of diamond/Î²-SiC composite films and its effect on protein adsorption. For systematic and high-throughput investigations, novel diamond/Î²-SiC composite films with gradient composition have been synthesized using the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) technique. As revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the diamond/Î²-SiC ratio of the composite films shows a continuous change from pure diamond to Î²-SiC over a length of âˆ¼ 10 mm on the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was employed to unveil the surface termination of chemically oxidized and hydrogen treated surfaces. The surface chemistry of the composite films was found to depend on diamond/Î²-SiC ratio and the surface treatment. As observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, albumin and fibrinogen were preferentially adsorbed from buffer: after surface oxidation, the proteins preferred to adsorb on diamond rather than on Î²-SiC, resulting in an increasing amount of proteins adsorbed to the gradient surfaces with increasing diamond/Î²-SiC ratio. By contrast, for hydrogen-treated surfaces, the proteins preferentially adsorbed on Î²-SiC, leading to a decreasing amount of albumin adsorbed on the gradient surfaces with increasing diamond/Î²-SiC ratio. The mechanism of preferential protein adsorption is discussed by considering the hydrogen bonding of the water self-association network to OH-terminated surfaces and the change of the polar surface energy component, which was determined according to the van Oss method. These results suggest that the diamond/Î²-SiC gradient film can be a promising material for biomedical applications which require good biocompatibility and selective adsorption of proteins and cells to direct cell migration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General SiC,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Adsorption;Animals;Biocompatible Materials;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/*chemistry;Cattle;Diamond/*chemistry;Fibrinogen/*chemistry;Hydrogen/chemistry;Hydrogen Bonding;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Serum Albumin, Bovine/*chemistry;Silicon Compounds/*chemistry;Surface Properties",24410163,other,#N/A,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

As revealed by scanning electron microscopy, the composition of the surface changed gradually from pure nanocrystalline diamond (hydrophobic) to a nanocrystalline beta-SiC surface (hydrophilic). Transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were employed to determine the presence of diamond, graphite, and beta-SiC phases. The as-prepared gradient films were evaluated for their ability to actuate water. Indeed, water was transported via the gradient from the hydrophobic (hydrogen terminated diamond) to the hydrophilic side (hydroxyl-terminated beta-SiC) of the gradient surface. The driving distance and velocity of water is pivotally influenced by the surface roughness. The nanogradient surface showed significant promise as the lower roughness combined with the longer gradient yields in transport distances of up to 3.7 mm, with a maximum droplet velocity of nearly 250 mm/s measured by a highspeed camera. As diamond and beta-SiC are chemically inert, the gradient surfaces can be used to drive hazardous liquids and reactive mixtures, which was signified by the actuation of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution.

However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)-based method is proposed to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide-silicon carbide (PI-SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5-fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI-PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed.

Silica particles and whiskers were mixed at various whisker:silica mass ratios, thermally fused, and combined with a dental resin at filler mass fractions of 0-65%. Whisker:silica ratio and filler level had significant effects on composite properties.

However, these strengths were still lower than the strength of cortical bone. The aim of this study was to develop strong and bioactive composites by combining CPC fillers with nano-silica-fused whiskers in a resin matrix, and to characterize the mechanical properties and cell response. Silica particles were fused to silicon carbide whiskers to roughen the whisker surfaces for enhanced retention in the matrix. Mass ratios of whisker:CPC of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 were incorporated into a Bis-GMA-based resin and hardened by two-part chemical curing. Composite with only CPC fillers without whiskers served as a control. The specimens were tested using three-point flexure and nano-indentation. Composites with whisker:CPC ratios of 2:1 and 1:1 had flexural strengths (mean+/-SD; n=9) of (164+/-14) MPa and (139+/-22) MPa, respectively, nearly 3 times higher than (54+/-5) MPa of the control containing only CPC fillers (p<0.05).

Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare the uniformly dispersed SiC(w) and HA composite powders, and SiC(w)/HA composites were fabricated by pressureless sintering. The interfacial bonding state and mechanical properties of SiC(w)/HA composites in different sintering atmospheres (air and N(2)) were systematically investigated. The results show that the uniformity of the composite powders decreases with the increase of SiC(w) content, and the cross-section of SiC(w)/HA composites gradually changes from glossy and smooth to rough and undulate. When the content of SiC(w) is 15â€¯wt%, the maximum bending strength and fracture toughness of the composites sintered in air atmosphere (HAW15) are 40.85â€¯MPa and 1.82â€¯MPaÂ·m(1/2) respectively, which are higher than those of pure HA. Compared with those of the SiC(w)/HA composites sintered in N(2) atmosphere, the bending strength and fracture toughness of the HAW15 composites are increased by 154.2% and 10.3%, respectively. Moreover, Simulated body fluid (SBF) and in vitro cell behavior tests indicate that the SiC(w)/HA composites still have excellent bioactivity. The possible strengthening and toughening mechanisms of SiC(w)/HA composites are that the dispersion of SiC(w) in HA matrix is improved by hydrothermal process, and the interfacial bonding property is enhanced because of the reaction fusion on interface of SiC(w)/HA composites during sintering in air atmosphere. The adoption of hydrothermal process improves the dispersion uniformity of SiC(w) in HA matrix. When sintering in air atmosphere, the interfacial bonding property of SiC(w)/HA composite is enhanced via the reaction fusion (SiO(2) is formed by the oxidation of SiC(w)). Both of them lead to the increase of strength and toughness of the composites.
