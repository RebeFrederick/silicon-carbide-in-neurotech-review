However, to ensure the flexibility required in some applications, minimize tissue reaction, and protect parylene from degradation in vivo an additional outmost layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is desired. In such a scenario, the adhesion of PDMS to parylene is of critical importance to prevent early failure caused by delamination in the harsh environment of the human body. Towards this goal, we propose a method based on creating chemical covalent bonds using intermediate ceramic layers as adhesion promoters between PDMS and parylene.To evaluate our concept, we prepared three different sets of samples with PDMS on parylene without and with oxygen plasma treatment (the most commonly employed method to increase adhesion), and samples with our proposed ceramic intermediate layers of silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon dioxide (SiO2). The samples were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at room temperature and were inspected under an optical microscope. To investigate the adhesion property, cross-cut tape tests and peel tests were performed. The results showed a significant improvement of the adhesion and in-soak long-term performance of our proposed encapsulation stack compared with PDMS on parylene and PDMS on plasma-treated parylene. We aim to use the proposed solution to package bare silicon chips on active implants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,General SiC,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Adhesives;Silicon carbide;Ceramics;Encapsulation;Delamination;Substrates;Chemicals,33018733,other,Neural_Engineering,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True

Presently, MRI imaging of patients with neural implants is highly restricted in high field MRI (e.g., 3 T and higher) due to patient safety concerns. This results in lower resolution MRI images and, consequently, degrades the efficacy of MRI imaging for diagnostic purposes in these patients. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is a biocompatible wide-band-gap semiconductor with a high thermal conductivity and magnetic susceptibility compatible with brain tissue. It also has modifiable electrical conductivity through doping level control. These properties can improve the MRI compliance of 3C-SiC INIs, specifically in high field MRI scanning. In this work, the MRI compliance of epitaxial SiC films grown on various Si wafers, used to implement a monolithic neural implant (all-SiC), was studied. Via finite element method (FEM) and Fourier-based simulations, the specific absorption rate (SAR), induced heating, and image artifacts caused by the portion of the implant within a brain tissue phantom located in a 7 T small animal MRI machine were estimated and measured. The specific goal was to compare implant materials; thus, the effect of leads outside the tissue was not considered. The results of the simulations were validated via phantom experiments in the same 7 T MRI system. The simulation and experimental results revealed that free-standing 3C-SiC films had little to no image artifacts compared to silicon and platinum reference materials inside the MRI at 7 T. In addition, FEM simulations predicted an ~30% SAR reduction for 3C-SiC compared to Pt. These initial simulations and experiments indicate an all-SiC INI may effectively reduce MRI induced heating and image artifacts in high field MRI.

While these issues have been overcome using stiffer, thicker materials as transport shuttles during implantation, the acute damage from the use of shuttles may generate many other biotic complications.

Their common failure mode is the degradation of insulating films and/or the delamination of the conductor-insulator interfaces.

APPROACH: We developed a fabrication method that integrates polycrystalline conductive silicon carbide with insulating silicon carbide. The technology employs amorphous silicon carbide as the insulator and conductive silicon carbide at the recording sites, resulting in a seamless transition between doped and amorphous regions of the same material, eliminating heterogeneous interfaces prone to delamination. Silicon carbide has outstanding chemical stability, is biocompatible, is an excellent molecular barrier and is compatible with standard microfabrication processes. MAIN RESULTS: We have fabricated silicon carbide electrode arrays using our novel fabrication method. We conducted in vivo experiments in which electrocorticography recordings from the primary visual cortex of a rat were obtained and were of similar quality to those of polymer based electrocorticography arrays. The silicon carbide electrode arrays were also used as a cuff electrode wrapped around the sciatic nerve of a rat to record the nerve response to electrical stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated the outstanding long term stability of our insulating silicon carbide films through accelerated aging tests.

We show that the structural and electrical properties of polycrystalline SiC are modified when changing the deposition temperature. Films with resistivity as low as (10.0 +/- 0.5) m Omega<middle dot>cm, a low residual stress of (-397 +/- 158) MPa, and a low root mean square surface roughness of (53 +/- 19) nm are achieved. Accelerated aging tests in heated phosphate buffer solution (PBS) show an etching rate of less than 1 nm/day and a steady low electrical resistivity for 77 days, indicating that the nitrogen-doped polycrystalline SiC is a chemically stable material, capable of chronic stability in a saline electrolyte.

Our goal is to develop flexible and extensible ribbon cables that integrate with thin-film, cortical penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and polyimide were employed as the structural elements of the ribbon cables and multilayer titanium/gold thin films as electrical traces. Using photolithography and thin-film processing, ribbon cables with linear and serpentine electrical traces were investigated. A cable design with an open lattice geometry was also investigated as a means of achieving high levels of extensibility while preserving the electrical function of the cables. Multichannel ribbon cables were fabricated with 50 mm lengths and metallization trace widths of 2-12 mu m. The ribbon cables tolerate flexural bending to a radius of 50 mu m with no change in trace impedance but tolerate less than 5% tensile elongation without trace failure. Ribbon cables with a lattice structure exhibit 300% elongation without failure. The high elongation tolerance is attributed to a lattice design that results in an out-of-plane displacement that avoids fracture or plastic deformation. Extensible ribbon cables underwent up to 50,000 tensile elongation cycles to 45% extension without failure. An electrical interconnect process using through-holes in the distal gold bond pads of the ribbon cables was used to connect to an a-SiC-based MEA. The electrical connection was created by stenciling a conductive epoxy into the through-holes, bridging metallization between the traces, and MEA. The interconnect was tested using a ribbon cable connected to an a-SiC MEA implanted acutely in rat cortex and used to record neuronal activity. These highly flexible and extensible ribbon cables are expected to accommodate large extensions and facilitate cable routing during surgical implantation. They may also reduce tethering forces on implanted electrode arrays, potentially improving chronic neural recording performance.

Chemical-vapor-deposited Parylene-C films were studied as an encapsulation material for such an implantable device. The surface morphology of an implant Affects its biocompatibility; thus, the Parylene-C surface morphology was investigated as a function of the precursor sublimation rate by atomic force microscopy. We found that high precursor sublimation rates resulted in slightly higher root-mean-square surface roughnesses (from 5.78 to 9.53 nm for deposition rates from 0.015 to 0.08 g/min). The crystallinity affects the physical properties of semicrystalline polymers, and various heat treatments were found to modify the crystallinity of Parylene-C films, as assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peak at 2 theta = similar to 14.5 degrees increased in intensity and decreased in full width at half maximum with increasing annealing temperature, indicating an increase in film crystallinity. Poor adhesion would compromise the protection offered by Parylene-C coatings. The adhesion between Parylene-C and silicon, amorphous silicon carbide, and boron silicate glass substrates were evaluated using the standard tape adhesion test from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of delamination failures. The tape adhesion tests indicated strong adhesion for all the as-deposited Parylene films with the application of an adhesion promoter (Silquest A-174(R) silane). However, annealing the deposited films at temperatures from 85 to 150 degrees C in air for 20 min reduced film adhesion, and also the adhesion testing procedure used significantly affects the results obtained. Supporting evidence suggested that the thermal stress generated in the films weakened the adhesive force. We concluded that the Parylene-C film properties (surface morphology, crystallinity, and adhesion) changed during deposition and thermal annealing, suggesting that the Parylene-C film properties can be tailored and that, with care, failure due to film delamination can be avoided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing","CVD thin film, adhesion, surface morphology, crystallinity, Parylene-C",,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True

The oCI probe comprises 144 miniaturized light-emitting diodes (Î¼LEDs) distributed along a bendable, 1.5-cm-long, 350-Î¼m-wide and 26-Î¼m-thick probe shaft, individually controlled via a n Ã— p matrix interconnection. In contrast to our earlier approach based on polyimide (PI) and epoxy resin with different thermal expansion coefficients, the Î¼LEDs and interconnecting wires are now embedded into a triple-layer stack of a single, biocompatible, and highly transparent epoxy material. The new material combination results in a pronounced reduction of thermomechanical bending in comparison with the material pair of the earlier approach. We developed a spin-coating process enabling epoxy resin layers down to 5 Î¼m at thickness variations of less than 7% across the entire carrier wafer. We observed that the cross-linking of epoxy resin layers strongly depends on the spin-coating parameters which were found to be correlated to a potential separation of epoxy resin components of different densities. Furthermore, various metallization layers and corresponding adhesion promoting layers were investigated. We identified the combination of silicon carbide with a titanium-based metallization to provide the highest peeling strength, achieving an adhesion to epoxy improved by a factor of two. In order to obtain a high process yield, we established a stress-free implant release using the electrochemical dissolution of a sacrificial aluminum layer. The direct comparison of oCI probe variants using a single epoxy material and the combination of PI and epoxy resin revealed that the epoxy-resin-only probe shows minimal thermomechanical probe bending with a negligible hysteresis. The thermal probe characterization demonstrated that the temperature increase is limited to 1 K at Î¼LED DC currents of up to 10 mA depending on the stimulation duration and the medium surrounding the probe. The optical output power and peak wavelengths of the new oCI variant were extracted to be 0.82 mW and 462 nm when operating the Î¼LEDs at 10 mA, 10 kHz, and a duty cycle of 10%.

Side permeation, defined as infiltration of molecules through the lateral surface of the thin structure, becomes increasingly critical with the trend of developing high-density and miniaturized neural electrodes. However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)-based method is proposed to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide-silicon carbide (PI-SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5-fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI-PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed. Increasing encapsulation's width (interelectrode spacing), creating stronger interfacial interactions, and integrating high-barrier interlayers such as SiC significantly enhance the lateral hermeticity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Encapsulation; Silicon carbide; Permeation; Thinfilm,38320746,Other,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True
