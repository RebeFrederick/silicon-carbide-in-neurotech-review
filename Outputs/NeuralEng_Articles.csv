However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain's foreign body response (FBR). This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the FBR to possibly enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the FBR is the use of MEAs with reduced cross-sectional geometries. Here, we fabricated 4-shank amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. Each a-SiC MEA shank was 8Â Î¼m thick by 20Â Î¼m wide and had sixteen sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes (4 per shank). A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized pre-implantation in buffered saline and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50Â mV/s and 50,000Â mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30Â kHz impedance values and 50,000Â mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50Â mV/s CV and 1Â Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6Â MÎ© to 13.5Â MÎ©Â at 1Â Hz, 1.2Â MÎ©-2.9Â MÎ©Â at 1Â kHz, and 0.11Â MÎ©-0.13Â MÎ©Â at 30Â kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50Â mV/s was 58.1Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 55.9Â mC/cm(2) on week 16, and at 50,000Â mV/s, 4.27Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 5.93Â mC/cm(2) on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of -0.19 per week. We also classified observed units as fast and slow repolarizing based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow repolarizing units declined at a similar rate. At recording electrode depth, immunohistochemistry showed minimal tissue response to the a-SiC devices, as indicated by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cell response between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices at 150Â Î¼m away from the implant location, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neuronal cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results warrant further investigation of a-SiC MEAs for future long-term implantation neural recording studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Siliconcarbide; Polyimide; Microelectrode; Immunohistochemistry; SIROF,38547834,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

A variety of emerging materials have been proposed for encapsulation of microfabricated implants, including thin-film inorganic coatings of Al2O3, HfO2, SiO2, SiC, and diamond, as well as organic polymers of polyimide, parylene, liquid crystal polymer, silicone elastomer, SU-8, and cyclic olefin copolymer.

However, to ensure the flexibility required in some applications, minimize tissue reaction, and protect parylene from degradation in vivo an additional outmost layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is desired. In such a scenario, the adhesion of PDMS to parylene is of critical importance to prevent early failure caused by delamination in the harsh environment of the human body. Towards this goal, we propose a method based on creating chemical covalent bonds using intermediate ceramic layers as adhesion promoters between PDMS and parylene.To evaluate our concept, we prepared three different sets of samples with PDMS on parylene without and with oxygen plasma treatment (the most commonly employed method to increase adhesion), and samples with our proposed ceramic intermediate layers of silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon dioxide (SiO2). The samples were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at room temperature and were inspected under an optical microscope. To investigate the adhesion property, cross-cut tape tests and peel tests were performed. The results showed a significant improvement of the adhesion and in-soak long-term performance of our proposed encapsulation stack compared with PDMS on parylene and PDMS on plasma-treated parylene.

In order to verify the results of our simulations we used a model consisting of a disk which is implanted into a cylindrical tissue phantom inside an animal bore found in the literature. Multiple electromagnetic and transient thermal simulations were performed on the disks made of various materials which are used commonly for the fabrication of neural probes including titanium, iridium, platinum, titanium nitride, and cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC).

It has the benefit of demonstrated biocompatibility, which makes it a promising candidate for chronically-stable, implantable INIs. Here, we report on the fabrication and initial electrochemical characterization of a nearly monolithic, Michigan-style 3C-SiC microelectrode array (MEA) probe. The probe consists of a single 5 mm-long shank with 16 electrode sites. An ~8 Âµm-thick p-type 3C-SiC epilayer was grown on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, which was followed by a ~2 Âµm-thick epilayer of heavily n-type (n(+)) 3C-SiC in order to form conductive traces and the electrode sites.

Presently, MRI imaging of patients with neural implants is highly restricted in high field MRI (e.g., 3 T and higher) due to patient safety concerns. This results in lower resolution MRI images and, consequently, degrades the efficacy of MRI imaging for diagnostic purposes in these patients. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is a biocompatible wide-band-gap semiconductor with a high thermal conductivity and magnetic susceptibility compatible with brain tissue. It also has modifiable electrical conductivity through doping level control. These properties can improve the MRI compliance of 3C-SiC INIs, specifically in high field MRI scanning. In this work, the MRI compliance of epitaxial SiC films grown on various Si wafers, used to implement a monolithic neural implant (all-SiC), was studied. Via finite element method (FEM) and Fourier-based simulations, the specific absorption rate (SAR), induced heating, and image artifacts caused by the portion of the implant within a brain tissue phantom located in a 7 T small animal MRI machine were estimated and measured. The specific goal was to compare implant materials; thus, the effect of leads outside the tissue was not considered. The results of the simulations were validated via phantom experiments in the same 7 T MRI system. The simulation and experimental results revealed that free-standing 3C-SiC films had little to no image artifacts compared to silicon and platinum reference materials inside the MRI at 7 T. In addition, FEM simulations predicted an ~30% SAR reduction for 3C-SiC compared to Pt. These initial simulations and experiments indicate an all-SiC INI may effectively reduce MRI induced heating and image artifacts in high field MRI.

The ability to produce well-defined micro-structures with properties that include chemical inertness, mechanical flexibility and low water uptake are key advantages for these devices. APPROACH: This paper reports the development of the transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) used to deliver intraneural sensory feedback to an upper-limb amputee in combination with a sensorized hand prosthesis. A failure mode analysis on the explanted devices was performed after a first-in-human study limited to 30 d. MAIN RESULTS: About 90% of the stimulation contact sites of the TIMEs maintained electrical functionality and stability during the full implant period. However, optical analysis post-explantation revealed that 62.5% of the stimulation contacts showed signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface. Such damage likely occurred due to handling during explantation and subsequent analysis, since a significant change in impedance was not observed in vivo. Nevertheless, whereas device integrity is mandatory for long-term functionality in chronic implantation, measures to increase the bonding strength of the metallization-PI interface deserve further investigation. We report here that silicon carbide (SiC) is an effective adhesion-promoting layer resisting heavy electrical stimulation conditions within a rodent animal trial. Optical analysis of the new electrodes revealed that the metallization remained unaltered after delivering over 14 million pulses in vivo without signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface.

The extent to which this response compromises the chronic stability of neural devices depends on many factors including the materials used in the electrode construction, the size, and geometry of the indwelling structure. Here, we report on the development of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). APPROACH: This technology utilizes a-SiC for its chronic stability and employs semiconductor manufacturing processes to create MEAs with small shank dimensions. The a-SiC films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and patterned by thin-film photolithographic techniques. To improve stimulation and recording capabilities with small contact areas, we investigated low impedance coatings on the electrode sites. The assembled devices were characterized in phosphate buffered saline for their electrochemical properties. MAIN RESULTS: MEAs utilizing a-SiC as both the primary structural element and encapsulation were fabricated successfully. These a-SiC MEAs had 16 penetrating shanks. Each shank has a cross-sectional area less than 60 Âµm(2) and electrode sites with a geometric surface area varying from 20 to 200 Âµm(2). Electrode coatings of TiN and SIROF reduced 1â€‰kHz electrode impedance to less than 100 kÎ© from ~2.8 MÎ© for 100 Âµm(2) Au electrode sites and increased the charge injection capacities to values greater than 3 mC cm(-2). Finally, we demonstrated functionality by recording neural activity from basal ganglia nucleus of Zebra Finches and motor cortex of rat. SIGNIFICANCE: The a-SiC MEAs provide a significant advancement in the development of microelectrodes that over the years has relied on silicon platforms for device manufacture. These flexible a-SiC MEAs have the potential for decreased tissue damage and reduced foreign body response. The technique is promising and has potential for clinical translation and large scale manufacturing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing","Animals;Basal Ganglia/*physiology;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/chemistry;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible/chemistry;Electric Stimulation/methods;*Electrodes, Implanted;Finches;Microelectrodes;Motor Cortex/*physiology;Rats;*Silicon Compounds/chemistry",28952963,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

While these issues have been overcome using stiffer, thicker materials as transport shuttles during implantation, the acute damage from the use of shuttles may generate many other biotic complications. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) provides excellent electrical insulation and a large Young's modulus, allowing the fabrication of ultrasmall arrays with increased resistance to buckling.

The 6 Âµm thick a-SiC shanks could penetrate rat cortex without an insertion aid. Single unit recordings from SIROF-coated arrays implanted without any structural support are presented.

It is well known that both electrophysiological recording and, to a lesser extent, stimulation probes suffer severe performance degradation over periods ranging from months to a few years. Performance degradation of implantable probes arises due to a number of factors, including systemic host response, glial scarring, cellular responses to non-inert materials and, importantly, probe material degradation and delamination. SiC has superior chemical inertness and molecule barrier properties that result in insulation endurance for long term applications in bodily fluids. We present a microfabrication process that employs both insulating and conducting silicon carbide thin films to produce a novel type of implantable neural probes which present no heterogenous material interfaces to the biological environment. The exterior of our devices is composed of seamless transitions between doped and insulating SiC, completely encapsulating metal traces necessary to reduce track resistivity. The fabrication process is specifically designed such that the only interfaces presented to the extracellular fluid are made entirely from SiC, thus rendering these arrays very resistant to long-term delamination and interface failure. This process presents an important path towards neural implants for truly chronic applications; the fabrication method can be readily applied to most variants of electrophysiological recording probes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Polycrystalline SiC",Silicon carbide;Electrodes;Insulation;Polyimides;Impedance;Degradation;Probes,,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

Their common failure mode is the degradation of insulating films and/or the delamination of the conductor-insulator interfaces. We sought to develop a technology that does not suffer from such limitations and would be suitable for chronic applications with very long device lifetimes. APPROACH: We developed a fabrication method that integrates polycrystalline conductive silicon carbide with insulating silicon carbide. The technology employs amorphous silicon carbide as the insulator and conductive silicon carbide at the recording sites, resulting in a seamless transition between doped and amorphous regions of the same material, eliminating heterogeneous interfaces prone to delamination. Silicon carbide has outstanding chemical stability, is biocompatible, is an excellent molecular barrier and is compatible with standard microfabrication processes. MAIN RESULTS: We have fabricated silicon carbide electrode arrays using our novel fabrication method. We conducted in vivo experiments in which electrocorticography recordings from the primary visual cortex of a rat were obtained and were of similar quality to those of polymer based electrocorticography arrays. The silicon carbide electrode arrays were also used as a cuff electrode wrapped around the sciatic nerve of a rat to record the nerve response to electrical stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated the outstanding long term stability of our insulating silicon carbide films through accelerated aging tests.

However, neural recordings from large mammals such as the pig can be anatomically hindered and pharmacologically suppressed by anesthetics. This curtails comparative inferences. To mitigate these limitations, we set out to modify electrocorticography, intracerebral depth and intracortical recording methods to study the anesthetized pig. In the process, we found that common forms of infused anesthesia such as pentobarbital or midazolam can be neurophysiologic suppressants acting in dose-independent fashion relative to anesthetic dose or brain concentration. Further, we corroborated that standard laboratory conditions may impose electrical interference with specific neural signals. We thus aimed to safeguard neural network integrity and recording fidelity by developing surgical, anesthesia and noise reduction methods andÂ by working inside a newly designed Faraday cage, and evaluated thisÂ from the point of view of neurophysiological power spectral density and coherence analyses. We also utilized novel silicon carbide electrodes to minimize mechanical disruption of single-neuron activity. These methods allowed for the preservation of native neurophysiological activity for several hours. Pig electrocorticography recordings were essentially indistinguishable from awake human recordings except for the small segment of electrical activity associated with vision in conscious persons. In addition, single-neuron and paired-pulse stimulation recordings were feasible simultaneously with electrocorticography and depth electrode recordings. The spontaneous and stimulus-elicited neuronal activities thus surveyed can be recorded with a degree of precision similar to that achievable in rodent or any other animal studies and prove as informative as unperturbed human electrocorticography.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data",Anesthetics;Animals;Brain/physiology;Humans;Mammals;Neurons/physiology;Pentobarbital;Swine;Wakefulness,36109613,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

SiC provides an ideal platform for long-term neural interaction as it is physically strong and chemically inert, and these properties make it an ideal candidate for interaction with the constantly changing chemical environment within the body.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Review,Neural Eng,General SiC,Polycrystalline SiC",,,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Recently we have shown that 3C-SiC does not attract a negative immune response from microglia in vivo, but the implants size did not allow adequate investigation of tissue response [1]. We produced a passive implant to test the in vivo tissue reaction of C57BL/6J mice to 3C-SiC and compare to our positive control of silicon (Si). Dual, triangular shanks were fabricated from each material and combined into a single device which was then implanted simultaneously into three C57BL/6J mouse brains for 35 days. The mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the brains treated using immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Si produced the expected increased inflammatory response from both microglia/macrophage and astrocyte cells, whereas 3C-SiC shows minimal inflammatory reaction from these glial cells. Si also created tissue voids larger than the implants themselves whereas 3C-SiC showed minimal voids and even still had neuronal processes in contact with the implant. Our conclusion is that 3C-SiC shows great potential for use within the neural environment and should be fashioned into active INI to evaluate signal quality over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Polycrystalline SiC",,,3C-SiC ,Neural_Engineering,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Our goal is to develop flexible and extensible ribbon cables that integrate with thin-film, cortical penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and polyimide were employed as the structural elements of the ribbon cables and multilayer titanium/gold thin films as electrical traces. Using photolithography and thin-film processing, ribbon cables with linear and serpentine electrical traces were investigated. A cable design with an open lattice geometry was also investigated as a means of achieving high levels of extensibility while preserving the electrical function of the cables. Multichannel ribbon cables were fabricated with 50 mm lengths and metallization trace widths of 2-12 mu m. The ribbon cables tolerate flexural bending to a radius of 50 mu m with no change in trace impedance but tolerate less than 5% tensile elongation without trace failure. Ribbon cables with a lattice structure exhibit 300% elongation without failure. The high elongation tolerance is attributed to a lattice design that results in an out-of-plane displacement that avoids fracture or plastic deformation. Extensible ribbon cables underwent up to 50,000 tensile elongation cycles to 45% extension without failure. An electrical interconnect process using through-holes in the distal gold bond pads of the ribbon cables was used to connect to an a-SiC-based MEA. The electrical connection was created by stenciling a conductive epoxy into the through-holes, bridging metallization between the traces, and MEA. The interconnect was tested using a ribbon cable connected to an a-SiC MEA implanted acutely in rat cortex and used to record neuronal activity. These highly flexible and extensible ribbon cables are expected to accommodate large extensions and facilitate cable routing during surgical implantation. They may also reduce tethering forces on implanted electrode arrays, potentially improving chronic neural recording performance.

The surface morphology of an implant Affects its biocompatibility; thus, the Parylene-C surface morphology was investigated as a function of the precursor sublimation rate by atomic force microscopy. We found that high precursor sublimation rates resulted in slightly higher root-mean-square surface roughnesses (from 5.78 to 9.53 nm for deposition rates from 0.015 to 0.08 g/min). The crystallinity affects the physical properties of semicrystalline polymers, and various heat treatments were found to modify the crystallinity of Parylene-C films, as assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peak at 2 theta = similar to 14.5 degrees increased in intensity and decreased in full width at half maximum with increasing annealing temperature, indicating an increase in film crystallinity. Poor adhesion would compromise the protection offered by Parylene-C coatings. The adhesion between Parylene-C and silicon, amorphous silicon carbide, and boron silicate glass substrates were evaluated using the standard tape adhesion test from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of delamination failures. The tape adhesion tests indicated strong adhesion for all the as-deposited Parylene films with the application of an adhesion promoter (Silquest A-174(R) silane). However, annealing the deposited films at temperatures from 85 to 150 degrees C in air for 20 min reduced film adhesion, and also the adhesion testing procedure used significantly affects the results obtained. Supporting evidence suggested that the thermal stress generated in the films weakened the adhesive force.

In this research, we investigated dopamine as a major indicator of diverse CNS diseases such as Parkinson, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and addiction, which are linked to chemical imbalance of dopamine (DPM). Silicon-carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs) were computationally synthesized with antimony (Sb) as the major dopant and doped with other transition metal, such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), or chromium (Cr), to improve the adsorption capacity of the nanotube materials through theoretical calculations based on density functional theory. This study elucidates the structure of modified silicon-carbide nanotubes for the application of dopamine biomarker. The majority of the systems show promising stability before and after interaction with DPM molecules, and chemisorption characteristic was observed following their adsorption with the DPM. The adsorption of DPM on the Antimony dopant SiCNT surface showed adsorption energy of -0.5442 eV, but after the inoculation of chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) transition metals on the Sb@SiCNT surface, the adsorption tenacity increased to -2.7211 eV, -2.7211 eV, and -3.5375 eV, respectively.

The oCI probe comprises 144 miniaturized light-emitting diodes (Î¼LEDs) distributed along a bendable, 1.5-cm-long, 350-Î¼m-wide and 26-Î¼m-thick probe shaft, individually controlled via a n Ã— p matrix interconnection. In contrast to our earlier approach based on polyimide (PI) and epoxy resin with different thermal expansion coefficients, the Î¼LEDs and interconnecting wires are now embedded into a triple-layer stack of a single, biocompatible, and highly transparent epoxy material. The new material combination results in a pronounced reduction of thermomechanical bending in comparison with the material pair of the earlier approach. We developed a spin-coating process enabling epoxy resin layers down to 5 Î¼m at thickness variations of less than 7% across the entire carrier wafer. We observed that the cross-linking of epoxy resin layers strongly depends on the spin-coating parameters which were found to be correlated to a potential separation of epoxy resin components of different densities. Furthermore, various metallization layers and corresponding adhesion promoting layers were investigated. We identified the combination of silicon carbide with a titanium-based metallization to provide the highest peeling strength, achieving an adhesion to epoxy improved by a factor of two. In order to obtain a high process yield, we established a stress-free implant release using the electrochemical dissolution of a sacrificial aluminum layer. The direct comparison of oCI probe variants using a single epoxy material and the combination of PI and epoxy resin revealed that the epoxy-resin-only probe shows minimal thermomechanical probe bending with a negligible hysteresis. The thermal probe characterization demonstrated that the temperature increase is limited to 1 K at Î¼LED DC currents of up to 10 mA depending on the stimulation duration and the medium surrounding the probe. The optical output power and peak wavelengths of the new oCI variant were extracted to be 0.82 mW and 462 nm when operating the Î¼LEDs at 10 mA, 10 kHz, and a duty cycle of 10%. The optical power corresponds to a radiant emittance of 407 mW/mm(2), sufficient for optogenetic experiments using channelrhodopsin-2.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,General SiC,Fabrication Method,Material Properties", cochlear implant; epoxy; micro light-emitting diode (?LED); optogenetics; thermomechanical behavior,30327585,other,Neural_Engineering,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False

We introduce herein a concept of long-lived flexible neural electrodes using silicon carbide (SiC) nanomembranes as a faradic interface and thermal oxide thin films as an electrical barrier layer. The SiC nanomembranes were developed using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process at the wafer level, and thermal oxide was grown using a high-quality wet oxidation technique. The proposed material developments are highly scalable and compatible with MEMS technologies, facilitating the mass production of long-lived implanted bioelectrodes.

While the scale of clinical devices is relatively large, translational, and pilot clinical applications are underway for microelectrode-based systems. Microelectrodes have the advantage of stimulating a relatively small tissue volume which may improve selectivity of therapeutic stimuli. Current microelectrode technology is associated with chronic tissue response which limits utility of these devices for neural recording and stimulation. One approach for addressing the tissue response problem may be to reduce physical dimensions of the device. ""Thinking small"" is a trend for the electronics industry, and for implantable neural interfaces, the result may be a device that can evade the foreign body response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review paper surveys our current understanding pertaining to the relationship between implant size and tissue response and the state-of-the-art in ultrasmall microelectrodes. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The literature review shows recent efforts to create microelectrodes that are extremely thin appear to reduce or even eliminate the chronic tissue response. With high charge capacity coatings, ultramicroelectrodes fabricated from emerging polymers, and amorphous silicon carbide appear promising for neurostimulation applications.

Side permeation, defined as infiltration of molecules through the lateral surface of the thin structure, becomes increasingly critical with the trend of developing high-density and miniaturized neural electrodes. However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)-based method is proposed to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide-silicon carbide (PI-SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5-fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI-PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed. Increasing encapsulation's width (interelectrode spacing), creating stronger interfacial interactions, and integrating high-barrier interlayers such as SiC significantly enhance the lateral hermeticity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Encapsulation; Silicon carbide; Permeation; Thinfilm,38320746,Other,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,False
