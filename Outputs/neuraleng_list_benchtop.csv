However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain's foreign body response (FBR). This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the FBR to possibly enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the FBR is the use of MEAs with reduced cross-sectional geometries. Here, we fabricated 4-shank amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. Each a-SiC MEA shank was 8Â Î¼m thick by 20Â Î¼m wide and had sixteen sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes (4 per shank). A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized pre-implantation in buffered saline and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50Â mV/s and 50,000Â mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30Â kHz impedance values and 50,000Â mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50Â mV/s CV and 1Â Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6Â MÎ© to 13.5Â MÎ©Â at 1Â Hz, 1.2Â MÎ©-2.9Â MÎ©Â at 1Â kHz, and 0.11Â MÎ©-0.13Â MÎ©Â at 30Â kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50Â mV/s was 58.1Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 55.9Â mC/cm(2) on week 16, and at 50,000Â mV/s, 4.27Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 5.93Â mC/cm(2) on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of -0.19 per week. We also classified observed units as fast and slow repolarizing based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow repolarizing units declined at a similar rate. At recording electrode depth, immunohistochemistry showed minimal tissue response to the a-SiC devices, as indicated by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cell response between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices at 150Â Î¼m away from the implant location, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neuronal cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results warrant further investigation of a-SiC MEAs for future long-term implantation neural recording studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Siliconcarbide; Polyimide; Microelectrode; Immunohistochemistry; SIROF,38547834,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True

However, to ensure the flexibility required in some applications, minimize tissue reaction, and protect parylene from degradation in vivo an additional outmost layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is desired. In such a scenario, the adhesion of PDMS to parylene is of critical importance to prevent early failure caused by delamination in the harsh environment of the human body. Towards this goal, we propose a method based on creating chemical covalent bonds using intermediate ceramic layers as adhesion promoters between PDMS and parylene.To evaluate our concept, we prepared three different sets of samples with PDMS on parylene without and with oxygen plasma treatment (the most commonly employed method to increase adhesion), and samples with our proposed ceramic intermediate layers of silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon dioxide (SiO2). The samples were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at room temperature and were inspected under an optical microscope. To investigate the adhesion property, cross-cut tape tests and peel tests were performed. The results showed a significant improvement of the adhesion and in-soak long-term performance of our proposed encapsulation stack compared with PDMS on parylene and PDMS on plasma-treated parylene.

In addition, we report the newly observed phenomenon of surface conditioning of the EG electrodes. The prolonged contact of the EG with the skin electrolytes functionalize the grain boundaries of the graphene, leading to the formation of a thin surface film of water through physisorption and consequently reducing its contact impedance more than three-fold. This effect is primed in highly saline environments, and could be also further tailored as pre-conditioning to enhance the performance and reliability of the EG sensors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,General SiC,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing",*Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;*Graphite;Reproducibility of Results,34874291,3C-SiC,Neural_Engineering,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True

While the phenotypic and cytoarchitectural arguments for 3D culture are clear, 3D MEA technologies are presently inadequate.

Our goal is to develop flexible and extensible ribbon cables that integrate with thin-film, cortical penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and polyimide were employed as the structural elements of the ribbon cables and multilayer titanium/gold thin films as electrical traces. Using photolithography and thin-film processing, ribbon cables with linear and serpentine electrical traces were investigated. A cable design with an open lattice geometry was also investigated as a means of achieving high levels of extensibility while preserving the electrical function of the cables. Multichannel ribbon cables were fabricated with 50 mm lengths and metallization trace widths of 2-12 mu m. The ribbon cables tolerate flexural bending to a radius of 50 mu m with no change in trace impedance but tolerate less than 5% tensile elongation without trace failure. Ribbon cables with a lattice structure exhibit 300% elongation without failure. The high elongation tolerance is attributed to a lattice design that results in an out-of-plane displacement that avoids fracture or plastic deformation. Extensible ribbon cables underwent up to 50,000 tensile elongation cycles to 45% extension without failure. An electrical interconnect process using through-holes in the distal gold bond pads of the ribbon cables was used to connect to an a-SiC-based MEA. The electrical connection was created by stenciling a conductive epoxy into the through-holes, bridging metallization between the traces, and MEA. The interconnect was tested using a ribbon cable connected to an a-SiC MEA implanted acutely in rat cortex and used to record neuronal activity. These highly flexible and extensible ribbon cables are expected to accommodate large extensions and facilitate cable routing during surgical implantation. They may also reduce tethering forces on implanted electrode arrays, potentially improving chronic neural recording performance.

Chemical-vapor-deposited Parylene-C films were studied as an encapsulation material for such an implantable device. The surface morphology of an implant Affects its biocompatibility; thus, the Parylene-C surface morphology was investigated as a function of the precursor sublimation rate by atomic force microscopy. We found that high precursor sublimation rates resulted in slightly higher root-mean-square surface roughnesses (from 5.78 to 9.53 nm for deposition rates from 0.015 to 0.08 g/min). The crystallinity affects the physical properties of semicrystalline polymers, and various heat treatments were found to modify the crystallinity of Parylene-C films, as assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peak at 2 theta = similar to 14.5 degrees increased in intensity and decreased in full width at half maximum with increasing annealing temperature, indicating an increase in film crystallinity. Poor adhesion would compromise the protection offered by Parylene-C coatings. The adhesion between Parylene-C and silicon, amorphous silicon carbide, and boron silicate glass substrates were evaluated using the standard tape adhesion test from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of delamination failures. The tape adhesion tests indicated strong adhesion for all the as-deposited Parylene films with the application of an adhesion promoter (Silquest A-174(R) silane). However, annealing the deposited films at temperatures from 85 to 150 degrees C in air for 20 min reduced film adhesion, and also the adhesion testing procedure used significantly affects the results obtained. Supporting evidence suggested that the thermal stress generated in the films weakened the adhesive force. We concluded that the Parylene-C film properties (surface morphology, crystallinity, and adhesion) changed during deposition and thermal annealing, suggesting that the Parylene-C film properties can be tailored and that, with care, failure due to film delamination can be avoided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing","CVD thin film, adhesion, surface morphology, crystallinity, Parylene-C",,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True

Dissolution rates of SiC, SiN x and thermal SiO2 were measured in accelerated soaking tests in saline at 87 Â°C. Defects in SiC films were revealed and analyzed by selectively removing the materials underneath those defects. MAIN RESULTS: At 87 Â°C SiN x dissolved at 18.3Â Â±Â 0.3 nm d(-1), while SiO2 grown at high temperature (1000 Â°C) dissolved at 0.104Â Â±Â 0.008 nm d(-1). SiC films demonstrated the best stability, with no quantifiable change after 112 d. Defects in thin SiC films appeared primarily over complicated topography and rough surfaces. SIGNIFICANCE: SiC coatings demonstrating no erosion in accelerated aging test for 112 d at 87 Â°C, equivalent to about 10 years in vivo, can offer effective protection of the implants. Photovoltaic retinal prostheses with PECVD SiC coatings exhibited effective protection from erosion during the 4 month follow-up in vivo. The optimal thickness of SiC layers is about 560 nm, as defined by anti-reflective properties and by sufficient coverage to eliminate defects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing","Animals;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Materials Testing;Prosthesis Design;Rats;*Retina;*Silicon Compounds;Silicon Dioxide/chemistry;Solubility;Surface Properties;Temperature;*Visual Prosthesis",27323882,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True
