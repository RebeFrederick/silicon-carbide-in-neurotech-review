However, the use of such material involves responsibilities due to its toxicity, and researchers are pushing towards the generation of new classes of composite semiconductors, including the Silicon Carbide (3C-SiC). In the present work, we tested the biocompatibility of Silicon and 3C-SiC using an in vitro model of human neuronal stem cells derived from dental pulp (DP-NSCs) and mouse Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs), a particular glial cell type showing stem cell characteristics. Specifically, we investigated the effects of 3C-SiC on neural cell morphology, viability and mitochondrial membrane potential. Data showed that both DP-NSCs and OECs, cultured on 3C-SiC, did not undergo consistent oxidative stress events and did not exhibit morphological modifications or adverse reactions in mitochondrial membrane potential. Our findings highlight the possibility to use Neural Stem Cells plated on 3C-SiC substrate as clinical tool for lesioned neural areas, paving the way for future perspectives in novel cell therapies for neuro-degenerated patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,Polycrystalline SiC,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Animals;Biocompatible Materials/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/chemistry/pharmacology;Cell Survival/drug effects;Humans;Mice;Neural Stem Cells/*drug effects;Neuroglia/drug effects;Neurons/*drug effects;Semiconductors;Silicon/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Silicon Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology;Surface Properties",31395932,3C-SiC ,Neural_Engineering,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,True

Part A,"Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) films, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), have been evaluated as insulating coatings for implantable microelectrodes. The a-SiC was deposited on platinum or iridium wire for measurement of electrical leakage through the coating in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Low leakage currents of <10(-11) A were observed over a +/-5-V bias. The electronic resistivity of a-SiC was 3 x 10(13) Omega-cm. Dissolution rates of a-SiC in PBS at 37 and 90 degrees C were determined from changes in infrared absorption band intensities and compared with those of silicon nitride formed by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Dissolution rates of LPCVD silicon nitride were 2 nm/h and 0.4 nm/day at 90 and 37 degrees C, respectively, while a-SiC had a dissolution rate of 0.1 nm/h at 90 degrees C and no measurable dissolution at 37 degrees C. Biocompatibility was assessed by implanting a-SiC-coated quartz discs in the subcutaneous space of the New Zealand White rabbit. Histological evaluation showed no chronic inflammatory response and capsule thickness was comparable to silicone or uncoated quartz controls. Amorphous SiC-coated microelectrodes were implanted in the parietal cortex for periods up to 150 days and the cortical response evaluated by histological evaluation of neuronal viability at the implant site. The a-SiC was more stable in physiological saline than LPCVD Si(3)N(4) and well tolerated in the cortex.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing","Animals;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic;Cerebral Cortex;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;*Electrodes, Implanted;Neurons/cytology;Rabbits;*Silicon Compounds;Spectrophotometry, Infrared",14613234,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Silicon (Si) has been the material of choice used for the manufacture of BMI devices due to its mechanical strength, its electrical properties and multiple fabrication techniques; however, chronically implanted BMI devices have usually failed within months of implantation due to biocompatibility issues and the fact that Si does not withstand the harsh environment of the body. Single crystal cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) are semiconductor materials that have previously shown good biocompatibility with skin and bone cells. Like Si, these materials have excellent physical characteristics, good electrical properties, but unlike Si, they are chemically inert. We have performed a study to evaluate the general biocompatibility levels of all of these materials through the use of in vitro techniques. H4 human neuroglioma and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell lines were used for the study, and polystyrene (PSt) and amorphous glass were used as controls or for morphological comparison. MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assays were performed to determine general cell viability with each substrate and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to quantify the general cell morphology on the substrate surface along with the substrate permissiveness to lamellipodia extension. 3C-SiC was the only substrate tested to have good viability and superior lamellipodia permissiveness with both cell lines, while NCD showed a good level of viability with the neural H4 line but a poor viability with the PC12 line and lower permissiveness than 3C-SiC. Explanations pertaining to the performance of each substrate with both cell lines are presented and discussed along with future work that must be performed to further evaluate specific cell reactions on these substrates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,Material Properties,Polycrystalline SiC,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","Animals;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/adverse effects/*pharmacology;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Survival/*drug effects;Central Nervous System/*drug effects/*pathology;Diamond/adverse effects/*pharmacology;Humans;Microscopy, Atomic Force;Neurons/*drug effects/pathology;PC12 Cells;Rats;Silicon Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacology",19585542,3C-SiC ,Neural_Engineering,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Analogous two-dimensional (2D) tissue cultures have been used for decades in combination with substrate integrated microelectrode arrays (MEA) for pharmacological and toxicological assessments. While the phenotypic and cytoarchitectural arguments for 3D culture are clear, 3D MEA technologies are presently inadequate. This is mostly due to the technical challenge of creating vertical electrical conduction paths (or 'traces') using standardized biocompatible materials and fabrication techniques. Here, we have circumvented that challenge by designing and fabricating a novel helical 3D MEA comprised of polyimide, amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), gold/titanium, and sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROF). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) testing confirmed fully-fabricated MEAs should be capable of recording extracellular action potentials (EAPs) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We then seeded induced pluripotent stems cell (iPSC) sensory neurons (SNs) in a 3D collagen-based hydrogel integrated with the helical MEAs and recorded EAPs for up to 28 days in vitro from across the MEA volume. Importantly, this highly adaptable design does not intrinsically limit cell/tissue type, channel count, height, or total volume.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,Fabrication Method,Benchtop/Soak Testing,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture",3D microelectrode;microelectrode arrays;iPSC sensory neurons; 3D cell culture,36296045,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,True

To overcome this challenge, there is significant research interest in the exploration of novel array architectures and encapsulation materials. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) is biocompatible and corrosion resistant, and has recently been employed as a coating on biomedical devices including planar microelectrode arrays. However, to date, the three-dimensional Utah electrode array (UEA) is the only array architecture which has been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for long-term human trials. APPROACH: Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that UEAs can be fabricated with a-SiC encapsulation and sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrode coatings, and that such arrays are capable of single-unit recordings over a 30 week implantation period in rat motor cortex. Over the same period, we carried out electrochemical measurements, including voltage transients, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), to evaluate potential failure modes. Furthermore, we evaluated chronic foreign body response via fluorescence immunohistochemistry following device explantation. MAIN RESULTS: During the indwelling period, we observed a reduction in active electrode yield percentage from 94.6â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰5.4 (week 1) to 16.4â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰11.5% (week 30). While the average active electrode yield showed a steady reduction, it is noteworthy that 3 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through 24 weeks and 1 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through the whole implantation period. SIGNIFICANCE: In total, these findings further suggest that a-SiC may serve as a mechanically and electrochemically stable device encapsulation alternative to polymeric coatings such as Parylene-C.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data","Animals;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Electrochemical Techniques/instrumentation/methods;*Electrodes, Implanted;Extracellular Fluid/physiology;Microelectrodes;Motor Cortex/*physiology;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;*Silicon Compounds",31013489,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,True

Due to lifelong implanted in human body and direct adhesion of neural tissues, the electrodes and associated insulation materials should possess an ideal bio-compatibility, including non-cytotoxicity and no safety concern elicited by immune responses. Our goal intended to develop retinal prosthesis, an electrical circuit chip used for assisting neural electrons transmission on retina and ameliorating the retinal disability. Therefore, based on the ISO 10993 guidance for implantable medical devices, the electrode prosthesis with insulation material has to conduct bio-compatibility assessment including cytotoxicity, hemolysis, (skin) irritation and pathological implantation examinations. In this study, we manufactured inter-digitated electrode (IDE) chips mimic the electrode prosthesis through photolithography. The titanium and platinum composites were deposited onto a silicon wafer to prepare an electric circuit to mimic the electrode used in retinal prosthesis manufacture, which further be encapsulated to examine the bio-compatibility in compliance with ISO 10993 and ASTM guidance specifically for implantable medical devices. Parylene-C, polyimide and silicon carbide were selected as materials for electrode encapsulation in comparison. Our data revealed parylene-C coating showed a significant excellence on bio-insulation and bio-compatibility specifically addressed on implantable neuron stimulatory devices and provided an economic procedure to package the electrode prosthesis. Therefore, parylene C encapsulation should serve as a consideration for future application on retinal prosthesis manufacture and examination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing,Biocompatibility, Cell Culture","interdigitated electrode, retinal prosthesis, parylene-C, bio-compatibility, bio-insulation",33266050,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True

In this study, a chronically stable class of thin-film devices for electrocorticography is manufactured incorporating silicon carbide and diamond-like carbon as adhesion promoters between glassy carbon (GC) electrodes and polyimide and between GC and platinum traces. The devices are aged in three solutions-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 30 x 10(-3) and 150 x10(-3) M H2O2/PBS-and stressed using cyclic voltammetry (2500 cycles) and 20 million biphasic pulses.

Results demonstrate that the devices are able to undergo chemically induced oxidative stress and electrical stimulation without failing but actually improving their electrical performance until a steady state is reached. Additionally, cell viability tests are carried out to verify the noncytotoxicity of the materials, before chronically implanting them into rat models. The behavior of the GC electrodes in vivo is monitored through EIS and sensorimotor evoked potential recordings which confirm that, with GC being activated, impedance lowers and quality of recorded signal improves.
