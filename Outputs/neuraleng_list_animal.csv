However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain's foreign body response (FBR). This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the FBR to possibly enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the FBR is the use of MEAs with reduced cross-sectional geometries. Here, we fabricated 4-shank amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. Each a-SiC MEA shank was 8Â Î¼m thick by 20Â Î¼m wide and had sixteen sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes (4 per shank). A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized pre-implantation in buffered saline and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50Â mV/s and 50,000Â mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30Â kHz impedance values and 50,000Â mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50Â mV/s CV and 1Â Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6Â MÎ© to 13.5Â MÎ©Â at 1Â Hz, 1.2Â MÎ©-2.9Â MÎ©Â at 1Â kHz, and 0.11Â MÎ©-0.13Â MÎ©Â at 30Â kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50Â mV/s was 58.1Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 55.9Â mC/cm(2) on week 16, and at 50,000Â mV/s, 4.27Â mC/cm(2) on week 1 and 5.93Â mC/cm(2) on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of -0.19 per week. We also classified observed units as fast and slow repolarizing based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow repolarizing units declined at a similar rate. At recording electrode depth, immunohistochemistry showed minimal tissue response to the a-SiC devices, as indicated by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cell response between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices at 150Â Î¼m away from the implant location, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neuronal cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results warrant further investigation of a-SiC MEAs for future long-term implantation neural recording studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing",Siliconcarbide; Polyimide; Microelectrode; Immunohistochemistry; SIROF,38547834,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Part A,"Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) films, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), have been evaluated as insulating coatings for implantable microelectrodes. The a-SiC was deposited on platinum or iridium wire for measurement of electrical leakage through the coating in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Low leakage currents of <10(-11) A were observed over a +/-5-V bias. The electronic resistivity of a-SiC was 3 x 10(13) Omega-cm. Dissolution rates of a-SiC in PBS at 37 and 90 degrees C were determined from changes in infrared absorption band intensities and compared with those of silicon nitride formed by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Dissolution rates of LPCVD silicon nitride were 2 nm/h and 0.4 nm/day at 90 and 37 degrees C, respectively, while a-SiC had a dissolution rate of 0.1 nm/h at 90 degrees C and no measurable dissolution at 37 degrees C. Biocompatibility was assessed by implanting a-SiC-coated quartz discs in the subcutaneous space of the New Zealand White rabbit. Histological evaluation showed no chronic inflammatory response and capsule thickness was comparable to silicone or uncoated quartz controls. Amorphous SiC-coated microelectrodes were implanted in the parietal cortex for periods up to 150 days and the cortical response evaluated by histological evaluation of neuronal viability at the implant site. The a-SiC was more stable in physiological saline than LPCVD Si(3)N(4) and well tolerated in the cortex.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Material Properties,Benchtop/Soak Testing","Animals;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic;Cerebral Cortex;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;*Electrodes, Implanted;Neurons/cytology;Rabbits;*Silicon Compounds;Spectrophotometry, Infrared",14613234,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True

The ability to produce well-defined micro-structures with properties that include chemical inertness, mechanical flexibility and low water uptake are key advantages for these devices. APPROACH: This paper reports the development of the transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) used to deliver intraneural sensory feedback to an upper-limb amputee in combination with a sensorized hand prosthesis. A failure mode analysis on the explanted devices was performed after a first-in-human study limited to 30 d. MAIN RESULTS: About 90% of the stimulation contact sites of the TIMEs maintained electrical functionality and stability during the full implant period. However, optical analysis post-explantation revealed that 62.5% of the stimulation contacts showed signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface. Such damage likely occurred due to handling during explantation and subsequent analysis, since a significant change in impedance was not observed in vivo. Nevertheless, whereas device integrity is mandatory for long-term functionality in chronic implantation, measures to increase the bonding strength of the metallization-PI interface deserve further investigation. We report here that silicon carbide (SiC) is an effective adhesion-promoting layer resisting heavy electrical stimulation conditions within a rodent animal trial. Optical analysis of the new electrodes revealed that the metallization remained unaltered after delivering over 14 million pulses in vivo without signs of delamination at the metallization-PI interface. SIGNIFICANCE: Failure mode analysis guided implant stability optimization. Reliable adhesion of thin-film metallization to substrate has been proven using SiC, improving the potential transfer of micro-fabricated neural electrodes for chronic clinical applications.

The extent to which this response compromises the chronic stability of neural devices depends on many factors including the materials used in the electrode construction, the size, and geometry of the indwelling structure. Here, we report on the development of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). APPROACH: This technology utilizes a-SiC for its chronic stability and employs semiconductor manufacturing processes to create MEAs with small shank dimensions. The a-SiC films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and patterned by thin-film photolithographic techniques. To improve stimulation and recording capabilities with small contact areas, we investigated low impedance coatings on the electrode sites. The assembled devices were characterized in phosphate buffered saline for their electrochemical properties. MAIN RESULTS: MEAs utilizing a-SiC as both the primary structural element and encapsulation were fabricated successfully. These a-SiC MEAs had 16 penetrating shanks. Each shank has a cross-sectional area less than 60 Âµm(2) and electrode sites with a geometric surface area varying from 20 to 200 Âµm(2). Electrode coatings of TiN and SIROF reduced 1â€‰kHz electrode impedance to less than 100 kÎ© from ~2.8 MÎ© for 100 Âµm(2) Au electrode sites and increased the charge injection capacities to values greater than 3 mC cm(-2). Finally, we demonstrated functionality by recording neural activity from basal ganglia nucleus of Zebra Finches and motor cortex of rat. SIGNIFICANCE: The a-SiC MEAs provide a significant advancement in the development of microelectrodes that over the years has relied on silicon platforms for device manufacture. These flexible a-SiC MEAs have the potential for decreased tissue damage and reduced foreign body response. The technique is promising and has potential for clinical translation and large scale manufacturing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Benchtop/Soak Testing","Animals;Basal Ganglia/*physiology;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/chemistry;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible/chemistry;Electric Stimulation/methods;*Electrodes, Implanted;Finches;Microelectrodes;Motor Cortex/*physiology;Rats;*Silicon Compounds/chemistry",28952963,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Arrays with transverse dimensions of 10 Âµm or below are thought to minimize the inflammatory response; however, the reduction of implant thickness also decreases buckling thresholds for materials with low Young's modulus. While these issues have been overcome using stiffer, thicker materials as transport shuttles during implantation, the acute damage from the use of shuttles may generate many other biotic complications. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) provides excellent electrical insulation and a large Young's modulus, allowing the fabrication of ultrasmall arrays with increased resistance to buckling. Prototype a-SiC intracortical implants were fabricated containing 8 - 16 single shanks which had critical thicknesses of either 4 Âµm or 6 Âµm. The 6 Âµm thick a-SiC shanks could penetrate rat cortex without an insertion aid. Single unit recordings from SIROF-coated arrays implanted without any structural support are presented. This work demonstrates that a-SiC can provide an excellent mechanical platform for devices that penetrate cortical tissue while maintaining a critical thickness less than 10 Âµm.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Material Properties",Amorphous silicon carbide; neural stimulation and recording; insertion force; microelectrodes; neural interfaces,30424413,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,False

Their common failure mode is the degradation of insulating films and/or the delamination of the conductor-insulator interfaces. We sought to develop a technology that does not suffer from such limitations and would be suitable for chronic applications with very long device lifetimes. APPROACH: We developed a fabrication method that integrates polycrystalline conductive silicon carbide with insulating silicon carbide. The technology employs amorphous silicon carbide as the insulator and conductive silicon carbide at the recording sites, resulting in a seamless transition between doped and amorphous regions of the same material, eliminating heterogeneous interfaces prone to delamination. Silicon carbide has outstanding chemical stability, is biocompatible, is an excellent molecular barrier and is compatible with standard microfabrication processes. MAIN RESULTS: We have fabricated silicon carbide electrode arrays using our novel fabrication method. We conducted in vivo experiments in which electrocorticography recordings from the primary visual cortex of a rat were obtained and were of similar quality to those of polymer based electrocorticography arrays. The silicon carbide electrode arrays were also used as a cuff electrode wrapped around the sciatic nerve of a rat to record the nerve response to electrical stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated the outstanding long term stability of our insulating silicon carbide films through accelerated aging tests. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical translation in neural engineering has been slowed in part due to the poor long term performance of current probes. Silicon carbide devices are a promising technology that may accelerate this transition by enabling truly chronic applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Fabrication Method,Polycrystalline SiC","Animals;Carbon Compounds, Inorganic/*chemistry;Electric Stimulation/methods;Electrocorticography/instrumentation/*methods;Electrodes, Implanted;Male;Peripheral Nerves/*physiology;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;Sciatic Nerve/*physiology;Silicon Compounds/*chemistry;Visual Cortex/*physiology",28573982,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,True

However, neural recordings from large mammals such as the pig can be anatomically hindered and pharmacologically suppressed by anesthetics. This curtails comparative inferences. To mitigate these limitations, we set out to modify electrocorticography, intracerebral depth and intracortical recording methods to study the anesthetized pig. In the process, we found that common forms of infused anesthesia such as pentobarbital or midazolam can be neurophysiologic suppressants acting in dose-independent fashion relative to anesthetic dose or brain concentration. Further, we corroborated that standard laboratory conditions may impose electrical interference with specific neural signals. We thus aimed to safeguard neural network integrity and recording fidelity by developing surgical, anesthesia and noise reduction methods andÂ by working inside a newly designed Faraday cage, and evaluated thisÂ from the point of view of neurophysiological power spectral density and coherence analyses. We also utilized novel silicon carbide electrodes to minimize mechanical disruption of single-neuron activity. These methods allowed for the preservation of native neurophysiological activity for several hours. Pig electrocorticography recordings were essentially indistinguishable from awake human recordings except for the small segment of electrical activity associated with vision in conscious persons. In addition, single-neuron and paired-pulse stimulation recordings were feasible simultaneously with electrocorticography and depth electrode recordings. The spontaneous and stimulus-elicited neuronal activities thus surveyed can be recorded with a degree of precision similar to that achievable in rodent or any other animal studies and prove as informative as unperturbed human electrocorticography.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data",Anesthetics;Animals;Brain/physiology;Humans;Mammals;Neurons/physiology;Pentobarbital;Swine;Wakefulness,36109613,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False

Brain machine interface (BMI) systems using implantable neuronal prosthetics offer the possibility of bi-directional signaling, which allow sensory feedback and closed loop control.

We produced a passive implant to test the in vivo tissue reaction of C57BL/6J mice to 3C-SiC and compare to our positive control of silicon (Si). Dual, triangular shanks were fabricated from each material and combined into a single device which was then implanted simultaneously into three C57BL/6J mouse brains for 35 days. The mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the brains treated using immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Si produced the expected increased inflammatory response from both microglia/macrophage and astrocyte cells, whereas 3C-SiC shows minimal inflammatory reaction from these glial cells. Si also created tissue voids larger than the implants themselves whereas 3C-SiC showed minimal voids and even still had neuronal processes in contact with the implant. Our conclusion is that 3C-SiC shows great potential for use within the neural environment and should be fashioned into active INI to evaluate signal quality over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Neural Eng,In Vivo Data,Polycrystalline SiC",,,3C-SiC ,Neural_Engineering,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False

While the phenotypic and cytoarchitectural arguments for 3D culture are clear, 3D MEA technologies are presently inadequate. This is mostly due to the technical challenge of creating vertical electrical conduction paths (or 'traces') using standardized biocompatible materials and fabrication techniques. Here, we have circumvented that challenge by designing and fabricating a novel helical 3D MEA comprised of polyimide, amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), gold/titanium, and sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROF).

Our goal is to develop flexible and extensible ribbon cables that integrate with thin-film, cortical penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and polyimide were employed as the structural elements of the ribbon cables and multilayer titanium/gold thin films as electrical traces. Using photolithography and thin-film processing, ribbon cables with linear and serpentine electrical traces were investigated. A cable design with an open lattice geometry was also investigated as a means of achieving high levels of extensibility while preserving the electrical function of the cables. Multichannel ribbon cables were fabricated with 50 mm lengths and metallization trace widths of 2-12 mu m. The ribbon cables tolerate flexural bending to a radius of 50 mu m with no change in trace impedance but tolerate less than 5% tensile elongation without trace failure. Ribbon cables with a lattice structure exhibit 300% elongation without failure. The high elongation tolerance is attributed to a lattice design that results in an out-of-plane displacement that avoids fracture or plastic deformation. Extensible ribbon cables underwent up to 50,000 tensile elongation cycles to 45% extension without failure. An electrical interconnect process using through-holes in the distal gold bond pads of the ribbon cables was used to connect to an a-SiC-based MEA. The electrical connection was created by stenciling a conductive epoxy into the through-holes, bridging metallization between the traces, and MEA. The interconnect was tested using a ribbon cable connected to an a-SiC MEA implanted acutely in rat cortex and used to record neuronal activity. These highly flexible and extensible ribbon cables are expected to accommodate large extensions and facilitate cable routing during surgical implantation. They may also reduce tethering forces on implanted electrode arrays, potentially improving chronic neural recording performance.

There has been interest in developing methods of tracking single units over multiple separate recordings to study neural processes that take place over several weeks or months, but to date these have primarily used high-density MEAs with hundreds of channels, which allow the use of spatial information in tracking units.

To overcome this challenge, there is significant research interest in the exploration of novel array architectures and encapsulation materials. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) is biocompatible and corrosion resistant, and has recently been employed as a coating on biomedical devices including planar microelectrode arrays. However, to date, the three-dimensional Utah electrode array (UEA) is the only array architecture which has been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for long-term human trials. APPROACH: Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that UEAs can be fabricated with a-SiC encapsulation and sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrode coatings, and that such arrays are capable of single-unit recordings over a 30 week implantation period in rat motor cortex. Over the same period, we carried out electrochemical measurements, including voltage transients, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), to evaluate potential failure modes. Furthermore, we evaluated chronic foreign body response via fluorescence immunohistochemistry following device explantation. MAIN RESULTS: During the indwelling period, we observed a reduction in active electrode yield percentage from 94.6â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰5.4 (week 1) to 16.4â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰11.5% (week 30). While the average active electrode yield showed a steady reduction, it is noteworthy that 3 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through 24 weeks and 1 out of 8 UEAs recorded greater than 60% active electrode yield at all times through the whole implantation period. SIGNIFICANCE: In total, these findings further suggest that a-SiC may serve as a mechanically and electrochemically stable device encapsulation alternative to polymeric coatings such as Parylene-C.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: a-SiC,Neural Eng,In Vivo Data","Animals;*Carbon Compounds, Inorganic;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Electrochemical Techniques/instrumentation/methods;*Electrodes, Implanted;Extracellular Fluid/physiology;Microelectrodes;Motor Cortex/*physiology;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;*Silicon Compounds",31013489,amorphous,Neural_Engineering,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Amorphous Silicon carbide (a-SiC), a robust material that is corrosion resistant, has emerged as an alternative encapsulation layer for implantable devices. We systematically examined the impact of a-SiC coating on Si probes by immunohistochemical characterization of key markers implicated in tissue-device response. After implantation, we performed device capture immunohistochemical labeling of neurons, astrocytes, and activated microglia/macrophages after 4 and 8 weeks of implantation. Neuron loss and microglia activation were similar between Si and a-SiC coated probes, while tissue implanted with a-SiC displayed a reduction in astrocytes adjacent to the probe.

Dissolution rates of SiC, SiN x and thermal SiO2 were measured in accelerated soaking tests in saline at 87 Â°C. Defects in SiC films were revealed and analyzed by selectively removing the materials underneath those defects.
